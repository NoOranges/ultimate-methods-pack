This is very simple method and doesn't take a lot of effort. I have managed to get a keyboard by filling one form and then emailing my address to them. And the keyboard came to my front door in 4 days. I have used this method 7 times and everytime it worked smoothly.

1. Go to http://support.microsoft.com/select/default.aspx?target=assistance

2. Select your product

3. Insert working PID

4. Make a believeable story, few tips to avoid many emails after filling the form...

-  The product has never worked
-  You got it as gift, therefore you don't have a receipt
-  You have tried the product on several computers

5. Wait for a response and then answer to all questions they ask and eventually they will ask "What's your address?". The amount of questions depends on the customer support guy and your description of the problem.

6. Enjoy your free microsoft product

And please don't spread this on any other site, let's keep this here. Yes, I know, this is already known by a lot of people, but I couldn't find this method from here and it's still working, so why not to share it.

(I posted this like 6 months ago, but it's in a wrong section at the moment. So I decided to post this in this section and close the old thread in the wrong section.)
