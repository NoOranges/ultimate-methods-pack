Well another method :D. This time for a decent enough TV. I don't think this was posted before, but I believe some know of this SE. Anyways the SE is simple just one call in and maybe one e-mail. 

I only tried this with a 32" TV so I can not say that it will work for bigger inch TV's being as I believe (don't quote me on this) some companies don't send out replacement for certain size TV's. 

Anyways lets get this started... 

Item's needed: 

Serial (definitely needed) - This is very easy to get. Just go on eBay and look up the Vizio TV you want and see if you can find the serial or if you can get the seller to send you the serial. 

Receipt (maybe) - You might get asked for one. In which case just generate one. A PayPal one will do just fine. 

Pictures (needed) - Depending on the problem with "your" TV you might be required to provide a picture of the the TV. They will request one main picture which will be of the one of the TV clearly showing the problem and or the "Vizio" logo. My problem had to do with a screen problem so I had to provide pictures. Easy enough to get, being as I Youtube Vizio problems and went with the first problem I found. 

Knowledge on TV (optional) - This can come in handy when explaining your problem. Knowledge can help you give them a problem that will require major fixing that way they go for replacement. 

Drop (recommended) - So you won't get billed at your address. Or you can always just say you threw it out, give it to courier, etc..

Steps: 

1. Get the serial and information to the TV you want. Register it (optional), but they will register it when you call-in. 

2. Call Vizio at 877.698.4946 and get to TV products/the type of TV you chose. 

3. Now give them your information and all that (usual stuff; serial, date of purchase, name, address, phone number, etc.). Get to the point where they ask you for your problem. Now let them know your problem. 

One problem you can use is one that has its own policy, but only if your TV has the guarantee so make sure you do your work on your TV. The problem is ZERO BRIGHT PIXEL DEFECT. Some TV's may have this problem and some TV's are guaranteed for replacement. You can Google your Vizio Tv model and see if it has that guarantee. 

Other problems you can use, dead pixel, dead pixel with dash line under it (what I used), TV doesn't turn on. 

Remember if you go with a screen problem (TV does turn on, just screen sucks) they will require pictures of the defective area. 

4. Depending on your option you might need to send in one email (the pictures) in order to continue. Then call back in and tell and get your replacement. 

You will not automatically get a replacement, you might be required to send it in for repair or take it to a authorized Vizio repair center. But the point is to get them to sent you a replacement as they do offer that option. 

Tell them you can't afford to sent it in (they make you pay to send it in), you can't walk, you know the usual routine, or hell just go out and ask for a replacement.  

5. Get your replacement. Enjoy or profit.

Didn't get it? Well it's simple; Your TV broke, you want replacement. 

This is a relatively simple SE. You just have to work your magic on the rep to send you a replacement. You can even use Bable's tutorial on how to sweet over a rep to make it easier on you. 

Hmmmm.... Well I don't know what else to say or put in. It's just a very simple method. 

Here are some pictures (first pic is of a 32", the one I went for, the second one is of a 39") that you can use when they ask you for some pictures. If you have a little editing skills you can easily edit dead pixels in there. You can get more pictures and the serials by searching online.

Here are some serials and information to some TV's. If you want you can try replacing the last digit/letter with a different digit/letter but I can not confirm that it will work (if for some reason they ask you for a picture of the back of the TV (the serial, model, etc.) pm me for a picture of it and I will provide it, but you will need to edit your information in):
