Another hp method.

1: go to bestbuy, frys, etc and grab some hp desktop serials.

2: register that shit to yourself

3: call in and say (part name) isn't functioning correctly

4: they'll offer replacement parts instead of whole new machine

did this to get myself a powersupply to power an amp. ( yeah, i did some nigger rigging to get my setup working)
