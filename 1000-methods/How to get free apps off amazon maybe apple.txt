You need some money before hand.
I did this on amazon

1) Go and download an app you want
2) After an hour of downloading it, go and talk to Amazon on their chat and explain that it doesn't work or something
3) They should refund you now
4) You have a free app, congrats!

Just a warning, if you reset your kindle, the app will disappear

Apple:
Doesn't really work for iOS.
The iOS method requires you to download the app onto your computer, then contact iTunes support 30 mins or something later saying that your child/friend/little brother has accidentally purchased an app/song/movie. Also mention that you don't know how to make it ask for the password every time so that it wont happen again. 

Rinse and repeat
