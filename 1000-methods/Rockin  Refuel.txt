Hey guys this is actually a super easy method, I just wanted to post it here so it doesn't get raped as bad.


1) Send an email to rockinrefuel@talktocurrent.com stating there was an issue with a case of chocolate 30g muscle builder you ordered recently. (you dont have to use this product, but thats what I have UPCs for)

2) They may ask for UPC/Batch codes. They shouldent if you limit yourself to just a case or two. 

3) If they do, attached at the bottom are 8 pictures of UPCs. Please dont use the pictures unless they ask for them.

4) You should get an email back like this one:

5) I told them yes, I had purchased it from their website. I gave her my info and she included 2 extra cases as apology. 
6) Wait for your order, then drink up!:Banane44:




This method really is simple, I just hope it doesent get raped too hard. Below are the pictures of batch codes UPCs for (chocolate 30g muscle builder)
