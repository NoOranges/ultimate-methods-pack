Ok so my friend at thebotnet.com released his method of where to get a vcc. It is priced at $1.4 for each card with one dollar loaded. So here are the directions: 

"Hey guy's im not gonna be as active on TBN and so i thought i would share mah method on how i got all mah vcc's. Here we go!

// Steps //

1) Head over to http://vcc-market.com 
2) For offers and shit like that select the gift VCC's
3) Select how much you want to load on the card
4) All cards cost however much u want on the card + 30% of the total

Example - If u load the card with 10$ it will cost u 13$ total

*Note quantity means how much you want on the card not how many cards you want*

5) You must have an LR account to pay because they dont do PP
6) They should email u in a couple of hours with the card info

// Things to know //

1) If you want for example 3 1$ VCC's buy a 3$ loaded vcc and then email the owner admin@vcc-market.com after u pay saying u want to have 3 1$ cards. He will hook u up
2) Try to buy in bulk you only get 1 1$ vcc loaded card and then u gotta buy in bulk

Good luck with this method and i hope it helps"
