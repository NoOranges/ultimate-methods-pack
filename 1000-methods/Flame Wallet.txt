This is my first method share so I hope you guys enjoy and I'll try to share as much as possible in the future.

I'm not going to hand feed you because if you can't make up your own excuse you're not really SE'ing anyways.

I will give you the basics and you can easily create up an excuse from what I give.

First Step:
Email the company.
magickohl@@yahoo.com

Second Step:
Understanding how Flame Wallet works.
 
This wallet works because the first layer in the wallet contains two pads for you to soak with lighter fluid with a flint switch that you strike with your index finger to ignite the flame. 

The first layer of the wallet also contains a magnet that keeps the first layer from opening up everytime because this is a normal wallet for normal usage afterall. Maybe the magnet doesn't work or isn't magnetized?

This wallet uses a spring system with multiple screws to adjust tension in the spring. This works so when you strike the lever the tension in the spring system will create a powerful enough strike to ignite the lighter fluid and burst into a controllable flame. Maybe the screws wont adjust the tension properly or the spring broke?

Third Step:
Waiting for the response.

Generally it takes 1-2 business days to get a response so depending on how hard this gets raped will probably determine response time because they are a smaller company as you can tell by the professional email.

They may or may not ask for a receipt. If they do, create a paypal invoice, amazon receipt, or a receipt on your own. 
I'll leave that up to you. Respond to the reps email accordingly like you normally would with any SE.

Fourth Step:
Receive your Flame Wallet.

It is completely safe to use your own address but I'll leave the logistics part of the method up to you.
