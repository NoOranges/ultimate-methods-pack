I've already tested this for games and I earned myself a nice, big £50 in my promotional gift card balance. It does work with everything else in the trade-in program. A lot of people have complained about the Trade-in service being poor, so this would be a target. This is effectively a box method for Amazon Trade-In.

Most of you should know this method, but if you don't, here's the method to help you out. Please keep in mind that doing this too many times will get your Amazon account closed.

Requirements

Box to Store Your Alleged Items - Don't be a fool and go for a tiny box. Choose and buy a box that will most likely store all of the items you choose.

Existing Items (Optional) - If you have a few games lying around or something that fits into the category of the items you are trading in, be sure to include that so Amazon will think you're legit. It may require some investment but ha, it will increase their trust that the courier actually lost the rest of the items.

Your Trade In Website -
US: http://www.amazon.com/Trade-In/b?node=2242532011
UK: http://www.amazon.co.uk/Trade-In/b?ie=UTF8&node=440443031
I believe that only Amazon US offers electronics trade ins.

Method

1. Go find something below $300 and initiate a trade-in.

2. Pack everything up and put in your existing items if you have decided to include them.

3. Tape the box, rip the tape off, slightly damage the box but make sure that the courier won't notice it and tape the box again.

4. Send it off via your courier. Spoof the weight with dry ice if you want to.

5. Wait until your trade-in is reported with items missing.

6. Get on Amazon customer service and complain how you sent everything in one box with tape saying FRAGILE ITEMS or something like that and tell them that they're scamming you.

7. Enjoy your (possibly promotional) gift certificate!

Conclusion

Just don't do this too many times if you use your Amazon account a lot.
Enjoy!
