We will be abusing the Trade-In service they have, for US, stick around $200. For UK it's 200£

Go to "my account"

Select "Your Trade In Account"

And submit a trade-in, for US I did a Qosmio X505 at brand new for $230

Go through the whole process, when you select how to ship select "use my own"

Now about 3 days later go on chat and ask if they receieved the item

They will launch an investigation, say you have no tracking

They will add the balance to your account.
