This tutorial is for people that recently received the Amazon Kindle and provided a credit card. If you are scared that they will bill/charge you for not returning the defective unit, and you did not use a drop than this tut is for you.

Steps:
1) Of course SE yourself an Amazon Kindle. I suggest you wait about 2-3 after receiving the kindle before proceeding to the next steps.
2) Call Amazon Kindle support: 1-866-321-8851
3) Make a reasonable excuse on why you can't return your kindle ( I used the excuse that I got burglarized and he/she stole my defected kindle, replacement kindle, my TV, AND credit cards. Therefore I cannot return the kindle.
4) You will be placed on hold/transferred to a "specialist."
5) After holding the specialist should say something along the lines of " I am sorry to hear about your problem of being robbed, I made it so that you will not be charged." And he or she should also say that, if you happen to recover the Kindle please give us a call back to arrange shipping the defected kindle back. Of course you're not going to call back.
6) Enjoy your free kindle with no strings attached.

Other information you should note:
- I waited about 3-4 days after I received my kindle before I called.
- I called Amazon Kindle Support really late at night, probably around 2 o clock in the morning central time.
- For me American reps can be dicks so I suggest calling until you get a preferable rep to your liking .
-I read a thread about Amazon canceling or disabling the Kindle if it is not returned within 32 days. So far my Kindle still works. I don't know if this method will bypass that.
-I am not responsible for what you do with this information. If you have any questions , feel free to send me a PM on the forums.

This tutorial was made by Vinneh of MagicPID and should stay only on MagicPID. I am only releasing this to the higher tiers (groups) to prevent leaks from the lower tiers. I hope to get accepted to contributor section soon (got denied, trying to contribute more) to release my other methods, so I won't have to ask someone else to post. If you would like to vouch for me please send me a PM (I have to ask). Thanks.
