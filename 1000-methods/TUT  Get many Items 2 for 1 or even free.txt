Hey guys, this is a simple method that can essentially get you a second product you have already bought, for free!

First off, you need to pick a company that sells sub-$100 products that have a relatively high customer base, and obviously sell something that you want or would be able to sell. 
For your first time, you might want to try something you have already bought, to get practice. Now a few days after you received the item, email or phone them using their contact page, about having received the packaging for the item, but not everything/the wrong thing was in there. 
Look below for one of my examples to Zen Magnets, who actually just refunded me the full price. Within a couple of days they should usually always reply with something saying that it was their error, and they will send you another/refund you. 

Again this is just a basic method, which just involves a few emails or a couple of minutes on the phone, but you can essentially get all your online products for free. PM me if you need help!

Products I have successfully done this with:
 - Mighty Wallets
 - Zen Magnets
 - Plantronics headset.
 - A whole bunch more!

My email to Zen Magnets - think of your own email when you try similar things:


Hello, on the 6th of June this year (Australian time) i made an order for the mini set of 72 Zen magnets (order number ##########).
Today I recieved the package to which i believed they would be in, but when i opened the parcel, all that was in there were the 3d glasses. now i know that it comes with 3D Glasses but i\'m just wondering if the Zen Magnets are coming in another package as i have not received them.
Thanks.


I got this response the next day:


Hello,

This sounds like a mistake on our part. I've refunded your entire order; please feel free to try again if you're still interested in our product. Our sincere apologies for the error and any inconvenience it may have caused.

Best,

Eric
