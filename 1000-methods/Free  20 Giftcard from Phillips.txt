So my lights died a week ago, and I decided to call Phillips, and in 5 minutes they offered to send me a $20 Home Depot Giftcard :p

All you need is the following:

-Name
-Address
-Purchase Location was Home Depot
-You did not keep original packaging
-Item purchased Exactly 7 months from this date
-You have TWO Light tubes, You could try more, but No guarantee on that though, as I did not test it
-And finally the information on this picture: http://www.lighting-gallery.net/gallery/albums/userpics/10077/normal_philips f32t8dx 6500k.jpg

Enjoy ur $20 giftcard
