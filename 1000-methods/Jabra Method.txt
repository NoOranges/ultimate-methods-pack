I am so very sorry that it has taken so long for me to post a method but this will be worth it.

1. first you are going to go to this website and pick out what you want. http://www.jabra.com/

2. Email them up with a complaint about how your device its not working. Examples (no sound, static, only noise from left ear, cord is frayed, ect...)

3. They will do some simple troubleshooting with you and will eventually ask for a receipt. (amazon for AstroProof works fine here :D)

4. Enjoy your new product :D
