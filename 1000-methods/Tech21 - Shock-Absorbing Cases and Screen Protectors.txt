Method

Email serviceteam@tech21.uk.com with your excuse. You don't need to type long paragraphs. Only a few sentences would do.
They will ask for Proof of Purchase and Image of Product (must show defect). 
Proof of Purchase is compulsory and can be generated. Image of Product is optional, but recommended to prevent this method from becoming patched. You can succeed with an excuse to bypass having to show an image of the product.
They will send you a replacement under a goodwill gesture.
