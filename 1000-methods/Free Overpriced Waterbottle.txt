Step 1: Head over to http://nalgene.com/product/ and select what you want to SE.

Step 2: Now go over to http://nalgene.com/contact/ and tell them something along the lines of it leaks or the cap doesn't hold or something.. Think a little its a waterbottle shouldn't be too tough..

Step 3: They ask for you address to send a replacement, so give them the address...

Step 4: Wait a few days to get the bottle.

Step 5: Profit!?!?

I know it's kind of a shitty tutorial but for a concept like this I will not spoonfeed you, sorry this is VIP. If you cannot SE a damn waterbottle you must've given a staff member a nice blowjob to get in here. Before you ask, no I will not give away any good methods of mine! Lol sorry don't like saturation.
