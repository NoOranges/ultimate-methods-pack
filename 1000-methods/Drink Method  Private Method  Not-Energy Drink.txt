Sparkling ICE

I just decided to post this, because like other drink SE's they will send cases ect...

What's Needed:

-Email
-A Brain
-UPC
-Lot Code (Higher Chances)(Not needed)

What you will acquire from this SE:
-Coupons
-Cases of drink
-Box of assorted


Instructions:

Step 1:
"Contact Sparkling ICE using the link here"

Step 2:
"Using your legit information, fill in the contact form"

Step 3:
"For your complaint, It may be any excuse for a drink. (These are carbonated)"
-No carbonation when receiving them

Step 4:
"They will email you back trying to "troubleshoot" asking questions as to why that had occurred."

Step 5:
"Email back with bullshit excuses as to why you threw them away, and all the excuses you need to provide"

Step 6:
"Should be done & they will offer compensation"



Notes:

-If they ask for a receipt (Amazon or Giant works)
-UPC can be found on Amazon or Google
-They provide tracking most of the time
-Regular Lemonade is the best
