Tell them your product's not working , and they'll ask you to do some trouble shooting .
And you will get a reply back asking you to send your product , to the address . 

Now find a reason to let them send in the headphones first .

Ex.
I'm a composer and i need the replacement of headphone real quick as I've a upcoming project . . .
