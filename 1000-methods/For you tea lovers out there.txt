Go to Teavana's website and browse their selection of goods. Getting tea is the easiest. They also have teapots and tea makers etc. This just covers getting yourself some tea. Find a couple flavors that you like or want to try and pick a quantity. Find their contact page and send them an email complaining that you bought some of their tea from their local shop in your area and there was something wrong with it. They will email you back apologizing for the issue and ask you for a receipt. Just say that you threw it out. They will then ask for the total amount and you can just give them an estimate. They will try to find the receipt in their records but won't be able to find it. They may ask you for a contact number so they can call you. Give them a burner and when/if they call just go over everything you previously said. In about another day they will send you the replacement tea since the process is taking so long.

Note: They do verify receipts so if you want one of their tea makers an Amazon receipt will not work.
