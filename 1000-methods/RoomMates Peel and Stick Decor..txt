The value of the item I did this for was $26.49, I haven't tried it for items that are more expensive.

Anyway, find the item you want.

E-mail them with a great use of capital letters saying how they were more complex to install then described, and how it got damaged in the installation (e.g. decal kept sticking to each other and ruined through taking it off).

They should usually give 2 day shipping, making the whole process 3 days, from the e-mail to the replacement showing up at your door.

I tried this for the Mario Kart Wii Giant Decal :3. No drop, no POP, no pics needed. I'm not held responsible if they get saturated and they strike back on you :3


Have fun, don't leech or I will be under your bed at night.

@Daxos  - here you go.
