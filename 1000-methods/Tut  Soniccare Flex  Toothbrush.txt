UPDATE- 11/20/11 Seems as if they always require receipt now, therefore use a Newegg receipt, yes they sell it, or Just Call them (Recommended)

UPDATE- Revelation said it was ok to make this post on the base that -"we need more methods in VIP", so dont complain please. Thank you

Ok, this tutorial is very easy, since i am a noob and was able to complete it! Although this tutorial is not for people who like to do call ins! anyways here it goes!

Step 1. go here http://www.usa.philips.com/c/electric-toothbrushes/flexcare-plus-5-modes-2-brush-heads-1-hard-travel-case-hx6972_10/prd/en/?t=support

That is U.S support not anywhere else! (as in that webpage, not the tutorial) 

Step 2. Call them, you will get a representative which will ask you for the serial code and the model number (they may not say model but it's some other word) anyways...

Serial code- Now this is easy to find, to find this number you = first 2 numbers are the year 10 = 20(10) next 2 numbers are the week 12= week 12. last 2 numbers dont matter.
(Algorithm was given by HappyChappy :D)

E.G= 101426
10= year so 2010
14=week so week 14
26= random numbers

So try like 110422 or 110534 something like that!

For the Model number or they may say HX number say= "6972"

they may even ask whats on the head of the toothbrush ="ProResults"

Step 3. COMPLAIN!

my excuse was that the handle would not charge whatsoever and that i even tried on my friends charger and it did not charge.

They will try to troubleshoot, just think as if you have the toothbrush in your hand and that your looking at it, and not just be like "NO"! right away. Eventually you will be able to get them to send you JUST the handle. If you ask them "Does the Brush head come with it?" they will respond with "No". BUT DONT WORRY, they send it anyways, that is just how it works!

Step 4. Receive the toothbrush!

You will not get anything but the toothbrush itself, no accessories, it will be on low power, so dont go crazy on using it.

Step 5. Wait a day and call them back yet again

You are calling them to get a charger, to receive the charger say that the charger you got was cracked on the bottom, as if someone was playing darts with it, then they will ask you some questions and what not. Try to make up your own excuse if possible, that one is just lame, but it works!

Step 6- Receive Charger in mail

Ok its the travel charger not the sanitary one, but w/e right?
Charge your toothbrush up and enjoy

Step 7- Brush teeth to contempt.

Have fun brah!
