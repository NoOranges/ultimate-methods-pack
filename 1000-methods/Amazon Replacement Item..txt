So tried this today with Kindles and it works perfectly should work with normal orders as well :D

Here it is few simple steps, No investigations no waiting nothing quick and easy.


1) SE Kindle /Order Item
2) Wait for delivery
3) Get someone else to answer door and refuse the delivery (Say something like he isn't in and he told me not to sign for his deliveries, Make something up)
4) Wait a few hours sometimes minutes and on the Amazon tracking page (orders) it will show that the item is being returned to seller (amazon) but actually isn't you just call up the shipping company and get them to redeliver the item or ask them to come and collect it.
5) Now call up Amazon or chat say the item is being returned to you could you send out another one and ask them if they could send out the order in your mates name as you work and you don't have enough time to stay at home and wait or go to pick it up...
