I hardly release any methods to VIP because they get leaked and raped hard. I'm releasing this one because you need a product number from the back of the pack to get the books, so don't try it without one and if you're VIP+ or someone I like, PM me and I'll explain.

Or they have a contact form on their website.


What is required

A code from the back of the multipack of notebooks.


The complete method

Give them a reason why a notebook could fail, you don't need a receipt, just the "batch" number from the back of the pack. I managed to get 3 at once, but it'd be nice if somebody could super-bulk them and do like 10 in one go. Oh, they also come in packs of 3, so try SE multiples of 3.
