This isn't as much of a social engineering trick as it is just some interesting information to get free doughnuts.
This is how it works:

1. Go to nearest Krispy Kreme about an hour to and hour and a half after closing (to make sure all employees have gone home).
2. Walk to the back of the shop and find the dumpsters.
3. Usually there are 2 dumpsters, one is used for trash and the like, while the other is filled with garbage bags full of unsold, warm doughnuts. 
4. Grab some doughnuts. Although you'd think you'd like to take the bags, you can't. The bags are filled with some many hundreds of doughnuts, you would practically need a crane to even make it budge. 

Just some interesting little intel. Enjoy.
