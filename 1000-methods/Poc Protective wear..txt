Hello VIP members, I know most of my methods have not been in this section recently so I decided to give you a personal favorite of mine. :D
 
This method will involve the company POC http://www.pocsports.com/ 

In this method you will start out by browsing the selection at http://www.pocsports.com/ and pick something you like, I got some gloves from them but I am sure that other equipment is possible. Most of there equipment is centered around protective gear such as helpmates, body padding and protective clothing.

Step 1: Find the product that you want to get from their sit and think of and excuse for it. 
Example: Gloves. You can say that when you received your gloves they had a rip and you really needed these for the winter.

Step 2: They might ask for PoP, if they do just use a receipt from the astroproof generator, it should work fine.

Step 3: They will want you to return your product, but this is where our good old friend biohazard comes in. For some of my excuses above you can say the rip irritated a cut on your hand end when you put the glove on the scab opened and started to bleed.

Step 4: If they still request you to send it in just keep insisting that you cannot and you are not one to break the law. They will eventually cave in and send you what you want.

Step 5: Receive your gear from poc!!
