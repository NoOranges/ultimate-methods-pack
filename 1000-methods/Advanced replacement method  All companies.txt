I have used this method to get an advanced replacement from Corsair. I am certain it can be used for all companies but I have not fully tested it yet.

Requirements:

Your own credit card or debit card.
Enough money to purchase the item.

Method:

Call up company and troubleshoot your item until you get to the RMA part, ask for advanced RMA. 
Give them your card details and let them take the money from it.
Ask for the expected delivery date and end the phone call.
Call your bank ASAP and cancel the payment.
Wait for your item to come in the post.

Tips:

Do not cancel anymore than 2-3 payments per credit card. If you do this often they will get suspicious. 

When you call your bank you might want to have a good reason ready if they ask why you want to cancel it. I said it was a mistake and I cannot afford to pay it right now. Make some bullshit excuse but really they shouldnt be asking in the first place.

Consider using a drop because you might be billed at a later date. Since you're using your personal credit card this might not stop a bill.
