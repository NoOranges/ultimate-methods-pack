Well , i'm not sure whether anyone has posted up this Tutorial before ..

Here's how it goes  .
 
You'll just need a convincing voice 

Call up the hotline of the retailer selling the product that you want (Let's say i need a Logitech Speaker Serial Number), speak as you're one of the Manager from Logitech .

Hi , Is this XXX Store ? : They'll say Yes (you could leave this part out if you want)
My name is "xxxxx" Manager of Logitech . 
And regards to this call that i'm making was to check that if you guys were to have the "malfunction" speakers that needs to be recalled back because a few of the speakers which were manufactured were found to be a fire/electrical Hazard and I need to collect a few Serial numbers to Identify them , than i could reach back to my boss and we could do a follow up .

Remember you need a very convincing sound to do this .
