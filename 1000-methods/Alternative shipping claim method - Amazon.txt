This method is very simple and I have successfully done it with high value items. Normally you would say the item never arrived/missing, this method basically switches it about. 

 1. Buy something from Amazon and wait for it to arrive (MAX 1 ITEM) 
2. Call Amazon and explain to them you want to return the item, ask if they can collect it.  
3. Keep the item and use the box method to return the item. I recommend you use dry ice, timing can be annoying though. 
4. Amazon will contact you, explain to them that you gave the item to the delivery driver on such a date at such a time.  
5. Wait and you will get your refund.   

Tips:  
Stick to your story, insist you gave the item to the delivery driver if they inform you the box was empty. 
 If they dont tell you the box was empty then dont bring that topic up. (Your not meant to know that unless they tell you.) 
Use dry ice to fake weight. 
Buy small but expensive items, avoid large items. Phones and tablets are good choices.
