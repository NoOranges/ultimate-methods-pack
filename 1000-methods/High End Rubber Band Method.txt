Hello, This is a another method by me. I hope to bring the VIP section to what it was supposed to be when a paid for VIP. (FML) Well here we go.


What you need:

 Fake Staples receipt**
A Brain
A Phone or Computer
Fake Name (inb4: http://www.fakenamegenerator.com/)


Steps:

Select the Rubber bands (I will use THIS)
Go to there website and click customer service or Contact Us
Type in a fake name
Type your real address
DON'T type you phone number (They will call.)
Say that you bought (Insert selected here) and they where dry and falling apart.
Say you have never had any issues with there product before
Send it
They will email you in about 24hrs and ask what size they where and where you got them from
Say the real size from the website and say Staples
They will send you a replacement bot of Rubber bands


**NOTE: In some cases they might ask for POP.
