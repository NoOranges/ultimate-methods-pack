Hey guys, it's nice to be back! And as long as the site's back up, how about an uncommon SE :)?

What's it for?


Well, I know that I can't be the only "herbal" enthusiast on this site right? Well, I was browsing the web and looking at some handheld vaporizers and figured "Hey, why not?" So I gave it a go, and it worked :) Not only did it work, but it was extremely easy.

Is it worth it?

 
I won't tell you guys exactly what I got ( There's so many companies that make handheld vaporizers it's ridiculous ) but I will tell you that it was a $250 dollar vaporizer so it's no piece of junk Haha


The Method


This is so easy you guys will think I'm kidding but seriously just get creative and it works.


Step 1: Find a company that sells vaporizers that run on batteries. Any vaporizer that runs on batteries will do.

Step 2: Message the company saying something along the lines of "Hey, I recently bought a vaporizer from you guys and when I was using it one day it randomly stopped working. When I went to try a new pair of batteries, I realized that the batteries leaked inside of the device! Is there anything you can do for me?" That's really all it takes guys, switch it up a bit and you have a pretty high rate of success.

Step 3: They'll probably ask you to provide a receipt for them. All I did was make a receipt for amazon and they sent my vaporizer out the next day :). If they ask for a receipt with an order number etc, get creative! Say you bought it at a head shop and make a receipt from there! There's all kinds of ways it can go so just remember, USE YOUR HEAD!


I hope I helped you guys out a little bit! Thanks for reading :).
