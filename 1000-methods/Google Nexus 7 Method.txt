Ok, this is going to be a very basic guide as I know that everyone here can determine what to say,etc. 

What I have learned when se'ing this Nexus 7 is that If you have bought the nexus from the google.com/play store, then they will 

replace it no problem*coming from a google store rep*, just like the kindles used to be. Buy one get one free?..However, my serial number was not linked to my google 

account so the representative forwarded me to Asus. 

I then contacted *Asus support* and there he will forward you to a customer care specialist. I kept explaining my 

problem(*Edit*Use own excuse!) From there they offered 

me an advanced replacement and then withdrew it for some odd reason. I simply used the excuse that they made me provide cc info 

and did not give me my replacement.I stressed the fact that they have thrown me from company to company over their own defective 

product and that I should have bought an ipad..After a few emails, he broke and sent me a replacement without* me having to send my old one back in. Got a 8gb wifi overnighted to me :D
