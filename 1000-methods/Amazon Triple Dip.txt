Again. Short. Sweet. To the point. Just figured I'd post these here...didn't see them posted already.

1) Buy the item from Amazon. 
2) Tell them the usual - it never came or nothing was in the box
3) Get a replacement first
4) Call a few hours later and ask for a replacement instead. Only do this after you see that the replacement has shipped

Done. They don't cancel the replacement item, so you basically end up with 2 of the same item and a refund

At least only one fag complain on the thread about it being copied...why complain? I don't see them posting shit worth reading. Not SGSII...but niggas know who they are.
