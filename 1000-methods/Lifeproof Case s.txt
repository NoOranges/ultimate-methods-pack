What is a "Lifeproof Case" ?

Lifeproof cases are for the iPhone 4 and 4S models only, they are designed to protect against everyday things such as dirt, water, snow and drop protection. These cases are available from most retailers such as Best-buy and Amazon for around $60.

How do I get one of these cases?




Go to the lifeproof website and go to the contact page "http://support.lifeproof.com/customer/portal/emails/new"
Submit a case to the support team regarding your problem, what I used was a water leak, they will reply back with troubleshooting steps and just basically say you did all that and the problem still is occurring.
They will then reply back asking for the serial of your case use this as a template: "RDK46316670"
After that they will submit the case to the replacement team and a day or so later you will receive and email with shipping and order information.
They say to send back the case but I would just email saying you did.


Thanks for taking the time to read this method on getting the LifeProof Case :skywalker:
