This isn't really a method i made. But it happened to me.

So long time ago, i was buying game gold (maplestory) from a person on a game hack forum, but as soon as i sent him the money,he logged off. Note, i didn't send him the money as a gift. (As i couldn't)

So I charged back immediately. But then the case went to "Being reviewed by paypal"

After around 10 days or so, i got an email from paypal and they told me i lost the case. So i got angry/furious and called them immediately as to why they sided with the "seller/scammer", they said the case was over bla bla bla and asked to provide them some proof. So I did.

Within 24 hours, i got their email asking if i'm willing to take a compensation of $50. Thought it was less than what i lost, but i accepted it anyway.

So in this case, i paid $81, got $50 from paypal. The scammer got his $81

If you need proof of email from paypal, i'll upload them later. Going home now. ^^

This is the rough story. If you are going to have a try, PM for some details.
