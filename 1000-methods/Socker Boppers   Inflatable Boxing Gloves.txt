Hey,
This method is for Socker Boppers or any other toys this brand makes. The brand that makes these is called Wicked Vision and I guess you can SE anything from them. 

Here is a link of all the products that they make:   http://www.wickedvision.co.uk/products.html

If you want to SE the Socker Boppers which are inflatable boxing gloves, all you have to do is email them.

1) Message them, saying you purchased a pair of socker boppers and while you were using them, the gloves ripped. EMAIL: hello@wickedvision.co.uk

2) You tried using the repair kit (which is just a sticker) and that didn't stop the air from escaping.

3) They will email you back saying they are very sorry and will ask for your address so they can ship a replacement to you.

4) Reply back to that email with you address.

5) If they ask for receipt which they didn't ask me for, you can generate an Amazon receipt.

The replacement that they will send you, will be only 1 pair of gloves so what you will need to do, is say you had 2 pairs of gloves and both had air escaping, they will then send you both which is what I did. If a lot of people try this, then what you can do is say nothing was in the box and receive another pair.

I decided to post this is the VIP section even though it isn't a VIP method since it could get saturated really easily and I don't really want that to happen. 



This is off topic but how do I view a thread which I made that is in the VIP section? I mean, I should be able to see the replies and reply back to anyone that has a question? 

More methods will be coming from me, just testing a few and seeing whether they will work or not.
