Alright, before you attempt this they are going to ask you what kind of camera you have now the first time I did it I did a camera that isn't even has compatibly with there card. 


1. Find out what camera you will be using for this SE at http://support.eye.fi/cameras/

2. Go to http://support.eye.fi/contact-support/

3. Not sure if they bill... So when using your own house be cautious.

4. Say something along the lines of 

Hi, I have a Nikon D4 and I use a Eye-Fi pro X2 on it and was taking photos for a client I had and all of the photos were streaming onto my ipad and all of a sudden the card started to malfunction I lost all of the data and the client...
Say, you were taking pictures and all of a sudden my camera displayed am essaged saying the card is locked.


Not that exact camera because that one isn't compatible.

5. Now they will begin to troubleshoot with you and then you can begin to just say nothing is working.
6. Now they will either say they will replace the card or they want you to send it back. If they say you want you to send it back ask if they have any kind of cross shipping. I said 

7. Now for some odd reason when I did it they shipped out the card before I was able to even reply to the ticket with a tracking number. Ended up not having to buy shipping + tracking.
