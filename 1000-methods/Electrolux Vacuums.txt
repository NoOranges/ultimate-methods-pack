Yeah so I know they're kinda cheap, but hey, what the hell.

Basically you call them, tell them your vacuum just stopped, mention that you've returned the same model to the store before because it's a piece of garbage.

They will ask you to send them in a label, tell them your wife threw it out, garbage day was today, etc.

They will tell you it's okay, they'll send a replacement, if you call the next day and emphasis your need for it they'll do overnight.

Here's my proof.
