Drop is recommended

1:Go to apc.com and pick out a product you want

2:Go to the support live chat and tell them a problem with your product they may or may not ask for serial, but usually they do. 
(Either tell them a reason why you can't tell them or try to go to craiglist, youtube, etc and find a serial.)

3:He may ask for a receipt if he doesn't your lucky :D
(the rep didn't ask me :D)

4:The rep should either send you a replacement
or do an advance replacement
or fail you because your receipt didn't work 
(i cannot confirm the receipt part because he didn't ask me)

Good luck
