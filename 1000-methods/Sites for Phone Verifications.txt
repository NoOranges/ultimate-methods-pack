Small Guide for verifications @zweemama
If you are iPhone or iPod or iPad user and jailbroken
 go to Cydia and add Insanilyi repo and search for "IACracker"
 install it and enable it in the sbsettings and open textnow and go and  complete the in-app purchase for 500+ credits and remove the ads and  also purchase other things for free.
 With IACracker you can make in-app purchases and not be charged anything, in otherwords: Free.
 
 IACracker does not work for all things such as Textfree, you can not buy minutes or anything but you can remove ads.
