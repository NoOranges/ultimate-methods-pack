Due to request, this method is now PM only. There are 7 brands in the guide and the guide tells you what each brand requires in order to successfully SE some alcohol! :)

Please PM if you have 50+ posts and have contributed some decent shit to AstroPID.

If you want to contribute any brands, PM me with proof that you can SE them, then I'll SE them and add it to the method, thanks
