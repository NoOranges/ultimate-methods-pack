Hi, so Duracell has been posted a lot before and has been told to be saturated, well in the UK it is not, however in the UK they do offer cheques, so you will have to do this via Bank Transfer.

1. Do your research, so what I did was find Battery powered cameras, heres one.
http://www.amazon.co.uk/Pentax-K-r-18-55mm-Lens-Kit/dp/B0042RTQO8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1338202282&sr=8-1

And then batteries
http://www.amazon.co.uk/Duracell-Ultra-MX1500-Alkaline-Batteries/dp/B003VVZYHE/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1338203122&sr=1-1

Expiry Date: 2017

2. Call up this number 0800716434 (Duracell P&G)

3. Find a problem with the batteries, I said they leaked, which is so overused, but oh well it still works.

4. Say then they made your camera not work, and you had to get it repaired.

5. They will take your details, and ask questions about batteries.

6. Use some of these for better chances
- Expiry DAte: 2017
- Only one battery leaked
- Say you through away the battery that leaked, however all the batteries in the box have expiry date of 2017
- Say you got it repaired at local camera shop - It's small so they don't have any receipts
- Amazon receipt the camera & Batteries(wont be required though)

7. They call you asking for Sort Code & Bank number - Enjoy your MONEY

I know Duracell has been posted, but I adapted this to UK and Bank transfer rather than Cheques since they dont send cheques
