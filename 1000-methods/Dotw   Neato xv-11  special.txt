Tell them you've got this Neato XV-11 and it's making a weird rumbling sound and not working at all . They'll ask you to return back the robots . I'm not going to spoon-feed you with methods on this , if not people will be using similar method and will pretty much "Saturate" as there's only 1 or few more Customer Service Agents for this . 

Please bare in mind you will need the serial for the machine on this , You'll find it on google
"NEATO XV-11 bottom".

Success Rate : 40% , Solely depends on how you tell them on not returning the product . 

Receipt : Amazon/Frys.com
