Most know this but I'm writing up anyway, @Super Mario already has a guide to remove EXIF data, but I find if you use Photoshop, this method is quicker and easier.

After you've finished shopping your picture, you'll want to remove the EXIF data.

Open the image in Photoshop, if it isn't already.
Press 'Shift + Ctrl + Alt + S', or go to 'file', 'save for web & devices'

Where it says 'metadata', click none, then click save. Now your image has no EXIF data.

I'd have added pics but I'm so lazy and for some reason print screen don't work.
