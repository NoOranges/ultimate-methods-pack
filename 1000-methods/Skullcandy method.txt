Buy any skullcandy headphones from the ONLINE store. Not their ebay store nor anywhere else. Also make sure you already have an account with skullcandy
Call in 1 week or 2 and say the headphones aren't working. I called in yesterday saying one side is much louder than the other
They will now want you to email them a picture with the cord cut off. Now to master this SE you must be fluent with photoshop and have the cord cut and and alter the cord so it touches the bottom of the surface. Also make sure there is no shadow. I also don't know if they check if the photo was edited through PS because I did this legitly.
If all went well they will email you the next day with the order name

Enjoy ;D
