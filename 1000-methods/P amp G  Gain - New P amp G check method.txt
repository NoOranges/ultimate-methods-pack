Totally new P&G method. I've seen a bunch of them (and used a couple), but this is totally different. 

What we're doing here is faking a receipt and complaining about a product covered by P&G's money back guarantee.

1. Go to this website. http://www.ilovegain.com/money-back-guarantee/laundry-and-homecare/
2. Fill in the form.
3. Fake a receipt.
4. Mail it in.

Of course, don't be an idiot and pick an item worth $3. Pick the huge pack on Amazon for a big check!

Enjoy!
