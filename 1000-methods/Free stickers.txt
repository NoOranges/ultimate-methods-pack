You have to choose an company e.g. Shell/playboy you name it. Then you are going to contact them by email saying something like this:
Dear Mr/Mrs,

DON'T COPY PASTE, COME UP WITH A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT STORY, YOU CAN USE CARS TOO.
 My name is HELLO LELLO. I am building an race moped that will be used in racing events. The moped looks very boring at the moment
 and I would like to know if you are able to send me some stickers for my moped, so I can put them on my moped. It ofcourse will benefit your company as I will go to every racing event or meeting, there will be a lot of people at each event and they will see the stickers. So I really would appreciate it if I could get some stickers.
DON'T COPY PASTE, COME UP WITH A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT STORY, YOU CAN USE CARS TOO.
 My adress if you are willing to send it:

Kind Regards,
Your Mom
