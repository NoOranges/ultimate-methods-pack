Find a face wash company and email them that you bought their product because yours recently ran out, but when you went to use it, it did not feel right and it was full of water and you were very dissapointed in their company because you usually buy their products. If they ask for a lot number, tell them that you can't read it. They will ask for your address,where you bought it and how much you bought it for,  send in your address. They will send you a free coupon or check for what the face wash is worth.
