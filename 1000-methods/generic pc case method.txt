this is a very simple method and will only work with the shitty chinese cases.
however this technique can be used for other products as well


contact whatever company you like  

tell the the welding is coming apart from the case where the motherboard sits 

at this point they will most likely  ask for pictures which you can photoshop and they send out replacement.

if they say they want the case back (rare for chinese sellers) then say the pc is a server and that is not possible as it would lead to taking down 4-5 websites.


done 


enjoy your generic case


now this method can be altered and done for higher end cases but that will require some excellent photoshopping skills on your end. furthermore they will ask for a receipt (higher end units) 
another excuse you can use is that the mounts for the motherboard weren't tapered correctly therefore you can't mount it correctly but this will lead to them wanting it back, you can say some were not tapered.


i have not included a company by purpose this stops saturating, i will not provide one over pm. 

good luck and post your success :D
