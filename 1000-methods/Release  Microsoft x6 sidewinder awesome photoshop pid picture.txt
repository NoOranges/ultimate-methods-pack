Here is my release of my x6 keyboard photoshop ! Comes with instructions about how to make your PID look legit and everything on the keyboard itself. I used this for my own keyboard! I thought I might as well release it.

In some cases, your pid might be INVALID and they'll ask you for a picture + a receipt. Get your own receipt now :)

Requirements:
A brain
Common Sense
Knowledge of how to use photoshop

I will not spoon feed you how to use photoshop ! Enjoy ~

I used photoshop CS3 for this.
