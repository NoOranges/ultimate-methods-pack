1.Call them, And say that your monitor has dead pixels/lines running through the screen/some other bullshit excuse. 
2.Trouble Shooting
yada yada yada....
3.If they don't offer the AR right away, just go ahead and say that you need the monitor for work or some other excuse. 
4. Give them the vcc and it'll be over nighted.

Don't ask for serials, or any more help, not fucking spoon feeding, go read their warranty, ^_^. It just happens to be a two day AR.

Edit; Sorry for not wanting to spoon feed all the brain dead leechers.
