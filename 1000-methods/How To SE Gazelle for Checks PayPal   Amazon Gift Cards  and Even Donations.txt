UPDATE/NOTICE/WARNING!: I believe this method may be saturated, which really isn't a surprise, so try it at your own risk. I'm not sure if they just knew it was me (the same person) which is doubtful as I used new everything (new address, name, email, computer, IP, etc.) or what but when USPS received my box they took pictures of the inside of the box before they processed or shipped it. So when Gazelle received it empty and contacted USPS, USPS send them the pictures of how they received it (empty). So not sure if Gazelle has USPS take pictures now or if it was random thing, which is doubtful as they pictures of two of my boxed (dropped off different days by different person). But I will suggest using Fed-ex. 

Another company I've had success with is Totem so you can try them @hellototem.com

This tut on on SE-ing Gazelle for checks, PayPal money, Amzon gift card, or even a donation to a charity. Gazelle is basically like 'Cash for Gold' except for electronics; phones; tablets; etc. 

I relatively new here so I don't know if this has been posted before, but I didn't see it anywhere so I guess I'll post it. 

What you will need:
IMEI or Serial number of the unit you're supposedly sending in. Since I'm in a site with nothing but SE-er's I assume you all know how to get this.

Steps:

1. Go to Gazelle.com.

2. On the tab you see click on the item you will like to "send in". Their list consist of Apple products, Androids, and few more. My first time I did an iPod Touch 4g(worst mistake ever as I only got $90), so I'll suggest going for like an iPhone 4g, Laptop. 

3. Now depending on what item you chose, you will either be taking to a offer page or another pages containing some of the units you picked, so you can choose exactly what unit you have. 

4. Once you choose what unit you have, you will either can an offer or have to answer some standard questions; Working condition, items included, etc. Click whatever you think will increase your offer.

5. Now once done with all that you will receive your offer. If you like it click "Accept/add to cart". 

6. Then process your cart. You will enter your name, email, address, city, etc. You can use your real information (I did). Oh and before I forget it will ask you how you will like to get payed; check; PayPal; Amazon Gift Card; Charity Donation. I choose check. So if you will like a PayPal donation, or Amazon Gift Card you will just enter your email address that you want it sent to, otherwise they'll ask you where to send the check or donation.  

7. Once you enter all the information you were asked for, you will either have the option to receive an empty box with a pre-paid label, receive a Fed-ex label through email, or USPS label through email. I choose USPS label through email as I didn't want to wait for the box and USPS is really unreliable in shipping units. 

8. Now package your box, make it look good  (You all should know how to) and go drop it off for shipping. 

9. In a couple of days you will receive an email stating they received the unit and are awaiting inspection. In another day or two they will tell you they received nothing and offer you a refund or they will ask some more question. You all know what to do, rage! Tell them you send it in, blah blah blah. Eventually they will tell you they cover lost/stolen items and they will ask for your to confirm what you want (check, etc) and to provide them with the serial or IMEI number of the unit you "send in". 

Bam! In a couple of days you should have your check, donation, etc. 

This was written very quickly so if I missed something or you need help just let me know. Also if this isn't allowed you can delete it. And sorry if this has been posted before. 

DISCLAIMER:
Try this at your own risk. I'm not responsible for any negative outcome if any for trying this. Social Engineering is illegal. 

Also I'm not leaking anything. I'm not saying I came up with this method first, but I did discover it on my own and released it on another site as well.
