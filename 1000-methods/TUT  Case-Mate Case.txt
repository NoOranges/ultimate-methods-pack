This is very similar to Incipio and Otterbox. I'm only just telling you this manufacturer, which makes pretty good cases.
This will require some Photoshop skills from you.

1.
Tell that your silicone case started tearing or something else.
Ask for replacement, because you really liked the case or sth.

2.
They are going to ask info about the product, where did you buy it, when did you buy it, where do you live and so on.
They will also ask for receipt and photo of the damaged product.

This is where you need some Photoshop skills. Amazon receipt is fine and that tearing is easy to do.
Search for Youtube -videos for your case, take a screenshot and edit it.

3.
They'll ship the product, if you didn't fail the receipt nor the picture.
My picture was kinda lame and poorly shopped but it got through. 
I used Amazon receipt.

Good luck, this will require some more time than SE's usually.
