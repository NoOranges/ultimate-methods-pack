Contact them through one of the following . Tell them you've problem with your Internet , tell them you've tried using your working Ethernet cable and you could get it to work but when you use the " Cables to Go Ethernet Cable " you bought it couldn't work and you're pretty sure it's faulty . 
They'll reply either asking for the Parts Number or Provide a POP (Proof Of Purchase) . Just provide them with the POP any sort will do . If you happen to use the Amazon's POP , just tell them you've tried contacted Amazon and they told you that you're not eligible for the replacement from them simply because they has a -- days policy .

And they'll ask for your address and will replace for you . I got mine in like 4-5 days i'm staying outside the state .

Big spools of RJ-45 is possible , but requires you to pay for the taxes . If you managed to get them to pay for everything , good for you .
