Basically amazon is really unorganized when dealing with customer service, this is really easy to do but requires a real order. 


method 1: multiple refunds

1.Call about an order that didn't come.

2. Get a refund.

3. Call about the same issue, get another refund.

4. This works but you have to confuse the rep a little. I did this by making an extremely long back story about my divorced parents and continuously linking it to the story.






method 2: multiple ar's

1. Get an advanced replacement

2. Call and confuse them and get them to create another ar for the same item.

3. Get your 2 Ar'd items

4.(bonus) Say they didn't come and get money back from your AR
