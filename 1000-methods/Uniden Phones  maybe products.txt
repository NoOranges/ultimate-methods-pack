This is a very simple SE. I was going to post this a while back but kept getting lazy to do anything and couldn't find my email chat logs with them. But hey, its about time I put something up as I haven't done so in weeks. Anyways I'll put it as simple as can be. This basically is a your product is being bad, replace it method. 

This tut will teach you how to get a phone, specifically, but it could be used to get any other Uniden product. 

1. Head over to Amazon.com. 

2. Look for an Uniden phone that they carry. Get the details for it; the model, etc..

3. Once you have that head over to Uniden.com and head to their support page and send them an email. 

4. At the page you will need to fill out your email, tittle (questions), product, model number (optional), and the problem. 

For Unidens phones (from personal problems I've experienced) they usually disconnect frequently (drop call), volume is low, etc.. So just let them know what your "problem" is with your phone. 

You will receive replies, the amount will depend on the agent. 

5. The replies will contain troubleshooting steps, etc.. Just reply in a day and let them know that nothing as worked. They will ask for proof of purchase. You can send them an Amazon generated receipt, PayPal invoice, etc.. Or if you're asked multiple different questions and asked for the receipt in the same email you can try dodging that questions by answering all of their questions and then asking some questions yourself. 

Once done you will be sent a replacement product.

There. Simple.  Just complain, generate receipt, replacement. 

You can probably use this, common sense, to get any of their other products. I personally haven't tried any other products as all I needed was a house phone but you're more than welcome to try and let us know how that goes. 

I will suggest using anything but an Amazon receipt (generated one) as those have become pretty saturated and most companies are catching on. That template that a fellow member, I forget his username, released could be used as it's less common. 

Nothing big here, at least not the phone lol, but their other products can be very nice. 

inb4saturation. 

If this becomes saturated you can always try any other phone manufacturer/company. Just be creative and nothing will ever become saturated.
