So the Jawbone UP was a fail, now they are doing a "NO QUESTIONS ASKED GUARANTEE".
I SE'd 2 of these UP's before, pretty pretty easy to do.
Now here comes the best part. You don't need to send your Jawbone in! That means, if you know someone who own's on of these bands, you can just use his email he registered his jawbone with and get up to 120&#8364; (EU)/ $115.44 (CAN) / £ 90.00 GBP (UK) / $109.43 (US). UK and EU get mastercard gift cards! 
I guess you could even call and say "Hey my UP doesn't even power on" - This way you can't get the serial from it - Maybe you get a refund too - NOT TESTED
Or make up your own reason why you can't get the serial from it... Be creative. It is not that hard, just read the FAQ and you should know what to say

EDIT: You don't need a receipt, box or else - nothing.. Just the Serial :)
