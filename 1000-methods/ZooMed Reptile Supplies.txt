Find ZooMed's website and something that you'll need or want for your pet. They sell most of their stuff on Amazon. Contact them and say you bought X item from Amazon (a cage) and when you received it there was something wrong with it (corners broken). They will ask for pictures of the item depending on what it is to determine whether or not you'll need a replacement or parts and a copy of the receipt. Any receipt generator will work for this. Make up some excuse as to why you cannot take pictures of it. At this point they will take a long time to reply. Send them another email asking why it is taking so long and that you feel as if your problem is being ignored. The rep will apologize and send out a replacement unit.
