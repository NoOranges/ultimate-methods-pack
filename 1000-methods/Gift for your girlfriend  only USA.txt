Hey guys, i found out a new company to get a good tweezers.

1. Go to: http://latweez.com/shop/

2. Choose a tweezer what you can find at:
http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=la-tweez&rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Ala-tweez

3. Contact them: http://latweez.com/contact-us/

4. Write/figure out: 

"Hey la-tweez support! I got a tweezer, but when i try to turn on, the light doesn't work."

5. They will reply something like:

"Hi, Please view on our website, www.latweez.com on the icon Q&A it explains which batteries are needed for replacement.

They are standard batteries that could be purchased everywhere."

6. Say: "I tried with other battery, but nothing." or something like that.

Enjoy your tweezers :)
