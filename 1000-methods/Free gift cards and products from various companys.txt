Well this guide isn't specifically aimed at any particular company. This guide has worked 100% of the time for me.

Well you know when your walking around a shopping mall or center and people try sell you stuff? Not try get you to donate to the "save the hairless lesbian orangutang foundation", I mean the ones who try sell makeup,face creams,paint-ball trips,herbal healing stuff and just about anything under the sun.

The method is pretty  simple. When they stop you, take an interest, act all keen and say look i have to run but if you give me your name and your company details ill contact you to buy some. The sales person will hand over his name and all the details of the company.

Go home call up the company and say that the sales person was rude when you told him you couldn't afford the product but would be interested later down the track. Let the person know that the only reason you couldn't afford it was to pay for your cousin's treatment after falling off his bike and becoming paralyzed or something equally as tragic and once the treatments done you had every intent to pay for the product and his immediate dismissal made you feel like a statistic and that his or her actions were hurtful. Really milk it out, tell them that its hard enough as it is without having being treated like that for not being able to afford their product at that point in time because of the accident.

They will turn around and give you a gift card or even some products for free. I have gotten paintball trips, fishing charters,makeup for my girl and more.

Simple,easy,enjoy,
