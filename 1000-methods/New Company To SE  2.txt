Hey astronians !! wassup ? time to share another company that is easy to SE.
Few days ago i was on a mall and on returns counter i heared employee saying that these products batch is really faulty this time. so i somehow read the brand name and it was Levi Strauss & Co



I went to their website and found specific website and sent complaint.

I was expecting some investigation but instead of that i got this mail :

Now here is the process:

1) go to http://us.dockers.com/home/index.jsp

2) select your product from their collection. I suggest select one at a time. i did 3 jeans one by one on same address and 2 tshirts on drop.But do one item at a time.
if you want to go bulk you can. i never tried it since i was getting free classy clothes in regular interval of time.

3)On the bottom of the page there is FEEDBACK option. select it

in that select issue with product.

WRITE YOUR EXCUSE. i said it bled and had white marks on if after i washed them. unable to wear it. 

4) they will reply like i showd at start of this thread.

5) generally they wont ask for send product back but if they do. say them like it was not able to wear it and since its winter i gave it to one homeless person who was in bad condition due to severe cold.and you will be good to go.

Again this is not some new method. This is just a company that replace you free stuff.

and if this is posted before. i would like to request any moderators to remove my post.

thanks for reading and enjoy your clothes.
