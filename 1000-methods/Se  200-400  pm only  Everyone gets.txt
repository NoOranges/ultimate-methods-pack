This method works best if you sell labtops, i used phones as an example because thats just what i was clicking on lol. This is very broad, electronics range from cellphones, to labtops, to tablets, to some lasers. There are countless sites for this type of thing i suggest finding another one if you dont want to do this one, or if it dosnt work where you live.


Again this is for educational purposes only what you do with it, is on you i take no responsibility for it etc...

And good luck there are other companies this will work for, try any electronics company and have them send you a box.

From here, they will send you a box, just box method them, when they tell you they didnt receive anything, act worried be like wait what... then RAGE THEM, they just lost your labtop or phone or whatever electronic/ item you picked. And they will generally refund you since the box is insured
