2) Send a message saying something like this. DO NOT COPY WORD FOR WORD.

Hello, I am a huge fan of your products. I have never had a problem with  a single item of yours, until now. When I received it, I plugged it  into my computer; but it was not recognized. I tried it on 2 other  computers, but the same thing happened. What is wrong with it?

3) They will email you back telling you to return it back to your manufacturer.

4) Tell them something along the lines of:

Hello, I did contact Amazon, but they refuse to take it back due to the  fact that I had purchased it over a month ago, while on vacation. They  say this violates their 30 day return policy.

5) They will tell you that they are going to ship out another mouse soon.
