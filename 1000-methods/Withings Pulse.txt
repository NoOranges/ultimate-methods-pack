I was pretty much looking for a company similar to the Nike Fuel bands and products along the line of that. 

If the SE never worked i would have just bought it, good product and it's cheap. 

Method: 

Contact them on why your product isn't turning on. It's brand new, but it seems to be drained of power even though you'v had it charging for a good few hours. 

They'll reply with some troubleshooting steps, you just need to say it's not helped. 

Straight forward new order replacement. Product comes next day delivery if you ask them for it. No need to return. 

Post any questions, also i'd be happy to post the email log if need be.
