Before getting started



You will need pin code, you can use this as a template "G89D3jd62D21djED", change some letters around until you feel you have a good pin.
 
You may or may not need a receipt, if you do make a fake one from CVS or your local grocery store.. 
A facebook account, no idea why you need this now but yeah policys change. I just use a fake facebook and then activate it on my real spotify account  


Contacting Support

When contacting support simply go to the bottom of the page hit contact us and go to the contact form. Send out an email and wait for a reply, come up with something creative like "I purchase a spotify premium gift card for my son and when he tried to activate it the pin code came up invalid"

Getting the Reply

After receiving the reply back they may or may not ask you for a receipt, most likely not and they will ask for the invalid serial you tried to activate give them a variation of the one about and your good. They will then reply with a fresh pin code!
