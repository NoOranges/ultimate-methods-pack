Hookers sold separately :(

I wrote this up for a sexy bitch a few weeks ago and now here it is for everyone!

To get hotel rooms just find where business people who leave your city make their last stop(airport, shuttle office, last diner on the way out of town, etc), dress nice, go in early and strike up a conversation about their stay and how you're just getting in(as you know, people love to give advice). You might have to talk to a few people but after a while you'll get good at spotting the constant travelers and then it's merely mining their business card(name/number/billing address of their company CC) and the name of the hotel they stayed at. 

-Now call n bitch that evening about how the room was made perfectly but when you got into your bed there were three used condoms that stuck to your foot and and the middle of the mattress was damp, so folks were fucking! You were going to just repress the memory but then your boss said you had to stay an extra three days so you would like to know how they're going to make that abysmal situation up to you. 

-I always add into the conversation a little snipit about how I'm an insurance sales prospector(or fake weed prospector if they look like stoners) checking out that area and in a month I'll be back with 10-20 salesmen who will stay for two weeks and I'll try to negotiate a future group rate so they really want to please me during the same call(please me now and I'll fill half your hotel next month). 

-Usually they set me right up and keep everything off the books so no one gets in trouble(night shift is usually a tight knit group) but worst case scenario(short of a rare flat no from a poorly paid Alan) they'll say they need a CC on file so just tell them to use the one you checked out with that morning(might have to verify billing info, say your wallets at the bottom of your luggage and ask if billing address will suffice, hence the biz card). 

-Viola, a free 3-5 day stay in a nice hotel room for an hours work and if they're really gullible you can demand complimentary room service so you eat for free too :D

Why clean up after a party at your house and risk noise complaints when you can party in a free room and be a "job creator" by leaving a fat mess?  Just be sure to leave a little chronic is the mess for the poor latino that has to clean it all up ;)

As some of you know I used to be a traveling sales guy and we always had to pay for our own rooms, this worked about 80% of the time for the two years I did that sleazy shit.
