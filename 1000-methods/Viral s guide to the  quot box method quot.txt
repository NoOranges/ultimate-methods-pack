We all know that the box method is sending a badly damaged looking and empty box to the company to make them think it was stolen in the mail, in order for you to get a replacement.

I have always gone about it a totally different way.

get your box then get a set of scales and then get sello tape like you find in your post office then weight exactly the same amount of tape as the item. This is easy as you can just peel off as much tape off the reels as you need in order to bring it down the exact weight.


Tape up the box and then cut it open with a stanley knife place the reels of tape in you weighed up earlier and tape it up.

This will pass all the scales of the post office and when it arrives at the company it will look like the postage company took the item as they have access to loads of tape and it was taped up twice.

enjoy,
