Haven't posted anything in awhile been just kinda seing random items but this seems to be easy enough iv noticed only tested in UK with Morrisons and Boots and superdrug

Basically get Gillette Vouchers buy a pro fusion or something then wait a week or so then return it, and you should get cash value for the item, just say something like it was a gift for my dad but he caen't use them with Christmas coming up there will be a lot of returns happening so it will be a good time to get some cash.

If there is anything I didn't explain so well let me know
