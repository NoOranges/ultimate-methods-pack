I know its the wrong method but i need help

1st of all here the Amazon kindle SE guide http://astropid.com/forums/showthrea...azon-Kindle-SE


I have 2 problems with this 



Right so I didn't use a vcc they requested a cc over the phone and they wanted to use an old one linked with my account i claimed that it was stolen and the card was cancelled. He then went to his manager and asked if he could bypass this without a CC he said yes , so they have shipped a replacement off to my house and in the email they sent me they said " Amazon.co.uk reserves the right to charge an amount equal to the price of your original order to the original payment card selected." so my question is say if the method in step 5 doesn't work and 1month later they ring and say we didn't received that kindle and they charge back on the original card will that get me more fucked ? ( i sent it to my real address and not a drop) and sorry 1 more question if i just say ive sent the kinddle back is that it over


And a new thing ive just learnt they say yodel will come pick up the package personally and clearly i dont have a broken kindle to give them but the guide above states that you just ring amazon up and tell them you sent it back but in the email it claims i have one month to send it back and yodel to come pick it up what should I do can anyone help me with both problems
