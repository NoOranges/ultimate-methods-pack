I am applying for VIP
i have been around magicpid and Astropid since the beginnings and have been very supportive of this product. I used to own a warez/hacking forum of 50k people and many other off the edge websites until I lost them when my server host fucked me over and then I joined the Israeli army as a combat fighter. I am a very supportive member and share all the secrets/exploits that I find on my own I am not one to hold something back I always tell the truth how it is being very helping and giving constructive criticism. I help those in need of help solving their errors or creating solutions to their problems. I edit released products an services to the way that people request and I provide results to requests or unanswered questions. I do not take without giving my share or without giving more than I take. I usually provide without even taking. I am a member who everyone loves and never rant or rave on others I only provide criticism to ell others realize their problems and act on them to fix their own. There are so many other reasons why I should become VIP that I can't think of at the moment but I can guarentee that you won't regret your decision of making me VIP! I am ready to start providing now! Please make me VIP I want to become one of the best like you!

Cheers
