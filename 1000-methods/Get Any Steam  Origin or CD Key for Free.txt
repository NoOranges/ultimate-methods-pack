I paid $25PP for this method. If you guys can give anything back to me out of your kindness, please do so.

Some idiots on HF have been selling this method. In order to prevent people from being scammed, here is the method:

1) Go to the eBay website for your country

2) Search for " key" or " cd key" and click on the most promising digital download result

3) Using PayPal, buy it with your own money

4) Once you get the code, do whatever you want with it

5) Wait 24 hours after you get the key code

6) Open a dispute and escalate it to the highest possible claim type and state that you obtained a virtual item whereas you thought you had obtained a physical item, as it stated in the eBay Terms of Service very  obviously that digital items were not allowed to be sold

7) You will be refunded as per eBay Terms of Service

Enjoy. Don't buy from people who sell methods.
