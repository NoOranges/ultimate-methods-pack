Gotten everything from tea kettles to tupperware.

Never asked for PoP or serials, or anything.

Excuse I used to tea kettle : handle came loose and fell off eventually after a couple of uses

Excuse I used to tupperware : lids were mis-shaped and wouldn't seal properly after washing

Excuse I used for sippy cup : lid wouldn't seal and leaked drink all over child constantly, causing me the very mess I tried to avoid.
