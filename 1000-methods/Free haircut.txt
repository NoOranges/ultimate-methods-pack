I don't think this method can be saturated and should work anywhere unless it is a very fancy place. By the way this is only tested in Boston and may not work in other parts of the world/country.

Instructions:
1. Go to a hair salon or hairdresser or barbershop place of your choice.
2. Ask for someone to cut your hair. Ask for whatever style, ask for whatever person, and etc.
3. At the end of the haircut inform your hairdresser that you are unsatisfied.
4. The hairdresser will probably ask if you want him/her to fix it up for you. Say no and that you don't want him/her to do anymore damage. Ask for the manager.
5. Complain to the manager, say how you don not think it is worth a payment , be creative.
6. Leave with a new haircut!

Note: This is to be done with barbers that charge extraordinary prices and not your regular barber who you know well.
