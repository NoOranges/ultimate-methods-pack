So I found a relatively small brand (don't worry, they're owned by a big  company, so it's not mean to SE them) and almost SEd them but failed  when they checked my amazon receipt, but they are very SEable.

They were offering a refund for a £70 product, but they have products up to £500+
Not even gonna post the product because I don't like shit being  saturated, if you want a copy of this method, you're going to have to PM  me (baring in mind, you'll have to conjure up a receipt or buy one  yourself when SEing these guys).
