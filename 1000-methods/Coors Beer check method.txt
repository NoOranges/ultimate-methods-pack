go to contact us on there site, complain that the beer tasted like dirty water and didn't taste like it was carbonated. They will ask you to call. You must have a bottle or can , they will ask you for the numbers at the bottom. Depending on how much you said you original bought is how much they will send you a check for.

Sorry, not going to write all fancy for this extremely simple method, i'll clean it up another time.
