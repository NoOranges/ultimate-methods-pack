Guys. Don't rape this one (: (kinda useless saying it)

This is my FIRST (: official contribution (oh yeah and 50th post!! woot!and it worked for me. So this is what you do. 

Step 1: Go here: http://nextorch.com/us/product.php and choose a product that you like

Step 2: Email Nextorch <usa@nextorch.com> and make up a story like this *MODIFY FOR YOUR DESIRED PRODUCT
(I remembered that the NT123A batteries had a recall recently: http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/prhtml11/11296.html)


Dear Nextorch,

Make up your own excuse. Don't ruin the method for others by copying and pasting. One importnat rule of SE'ing is that you need to be able to think fast and be creative. Practice makes perfect. 

-coin100 (some n00b made me take down the example I had written because he CTRL^C CTRL^V F***'d this up)



Step 3: Wait a one/few day(s) and you should have this back in reply:


Hi Brian,

 

My name is David Elliott I&#8217;m a customer service rep. with the Nextorch Co. I&#8217;m sorry you&#8217;re havening problems with our light if you
 could send me your shipping information and the model number of your  light I will be glad to send you out a new flashlight and a 
return tag for the flashlight that has the problem. We need to inspect the light to find out what the problem is and correct it.


 



                                                  Thank You for supporting our product.


                                                                   David Elliott  




Step 4: Email him back with the product number and wait for the package (:

Step 5: For those of you who don't understand, we won't be sending our "flashlight" back to him. To maintain good relationships and to prevent this method from getting raped too quickly/ him getting suspicious, we will email him AFTER WE GET THE REPLACEMENT saying: 


I left out the flashlight last night. However when I was at work today, my wife/friend/whatever threw it away because they 
thought it was broken and not needed anymore. I am extremely sorry and I hope that you will understand.



Enjoy your free flashlight and try not to rape this (:
