Arr0w is releasing a few methods so I figured I would do the same,but I am going to spread mine out a little bit more. One every three days for a couple weeks.

 The first one will be for an very interesting Alarm Clock that doesn't wake you up to a stressful BEEP noise so just PM me with the title " Alarm Clock" and I'll be sure to get back to you.

Simple enough right? :)



If you have any suggestions just comment below and I'll respond to em'.
