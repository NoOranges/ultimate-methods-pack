Not really a method per say but it does work so give it a try, I came up with it and have not seen it anywhere else so let&#8217;s get started.

Start by placing an order like regular I ordered the &#8220;Natural Ergonomic Desktop 7000&#8221; when I received it I replayed stating that that&#8217;s not what I ordered.

I requested it replaced with the arc touch mouse and keyboard.They will not ask for a new PID

So now you will have two orders this is where you milk them, call up and give them your case number tell them you were promised a complementary upgrade for your webcam for all the inconvenience caused by they delays in shipping and them getting your ordered wrong.

They may or may not ask for a PID, they asked me for a PID I gave them the PID (a PID I had used before lol) for a life cam 3000 they replaced it with the life cam 3000 HD. 


Replace my products with whatever products you want but start with a multipack so they can replace a mouse and keyboard.

TL;DR make 1 order, receive order say its not what you ordered receive 2 new items ask for a complementary upgrade get another thing for free.
