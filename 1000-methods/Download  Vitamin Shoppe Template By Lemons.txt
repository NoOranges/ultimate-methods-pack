I have noticed that a lot of people like to SE vitamins and workout supplements, I figured that at least one person would like a Vitamin Shoppe template. 

This receipt template was made by me, and intended solely for use at the MagicPID support forums. To request a template, just ask me in this thread. 

Please do not re-upload this file. If I find it uploaded on another site, I will imminently take down my version- and require that new uploaded one be taken down also. If you find this re-uploaded on another site, don't flame the person, just alert me of it. Thanks.
