If any of you guys travel, you know about the sick private areas airlines have at their major hubs. Since Delta is the big airline in my area (and many others), they have the private club which is known as the sky club. The sky club is basically an area that has percs like free drinks, snacks, wifi, luxurious seating and then depending on how nice your airport is, a ton more. I fly out of DTW and it even includes these sick private shower areas that are basically master bathrooms you can use to freshen up. Anyway, here is the method:

1. Buy a 1 day pass to your sky club a few days before you fly out (costs like 50)
2. Enjoy the sky club percs and talk to businessmen while having a free drink(s)
3. Arrive at your destination and when you have a minute, call delta and complain that you ate snack x or drank drink y and got sick from it and now you're pissed.
4. They'll offer a refund. Take it.
