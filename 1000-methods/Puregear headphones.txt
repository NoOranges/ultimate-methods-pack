Okay this is my own personal method.First pick out the headphones from pure gearhttp://www.pure-gear.com/shop-by-category/audio.html I switch it up, but from my experience the easiest ones are  these http://www.pure-gear.com/shop-by-category/audio/pureboom-advanced-performance-in-ear-headset-black-gray.html After deciding which headphones it is pretty easy email them at customer.service@pure-gear.com I said something like " I recently bought these headphones from amazon. It worked okay for a little while the mic was dumb. Blah blah blah now it does not work can you fix these?" They will then ask for a receipt just give them an amazon receipt then they will ask for your address and junk. I am a paranoid guy, so I use a drop house and use fake info.  I highly recommend it for this because they will ask for the original headphones back. They will then ship it fedex and you will receive your box in 3 to 6 days. Inside the box will be brand new headphones and a return label. I just sent them a empty box and it seemed to work, but be safe.  Proof: Sorry I blacked so much out. I always believe better safe than sorry.1048P.S I am guessing that within an hour or two of me releasing this method it will get raped so I would hurry


EDIT: Oh and if they ask for a receipt amazon generator works just fine.
