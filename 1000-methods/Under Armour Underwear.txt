Well, I heard under armour underwear was pretty damn comfy so I figured why pay $20+ for some underwear when I can probably get them for free. So I emailed under armour and got 1 pair of underwear in 2 days. 

First you want to figure out which pair you are going to want to SE. I dont like short boxers so I did the 6" boxer briefs.

Next off you are going to want to email or call them. I emailed them. Their info can be found here http://www.underarmour.com/shop/us/en/customer-service

For your excuse come up with something that seems legit. I said I went for a jog and that they ripped.

They should ask for you to comfirm which ones you want and they will ship them out. Enjoy your comfy ass underwear.
