  I'm not gonna tell you faggot what to do to get the check but really..
 Just make up something.. in my case I told them their shitty bag broke and my laptop broke and I had to get the screen fixed.. 
 They will ask you for pictures of the laptop and a receipt of getting it fixed.. here is where your photoshop skills come in..
 They are gonna make you wait a little bit because the president has to review it etc..etc..
 Anyways go rape it do w/e you want.. I'm out Y0L0


Sorry if the thread doesn't look good but Y0L0 too lazy
 

THIS CAN BE USED WITH A LOT OF DIFFERENT BAG COMPANIES!! 
JUST FIND THE VULNERABLE ONE
