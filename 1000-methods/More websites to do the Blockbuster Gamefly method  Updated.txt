Due to the large amount of replies, and not being able to edit my post, i'm just going to make a new thread and add all the updates.



If you're tired of waiting for games to become available, or can't use Blocketbuster/gamefly anymore, Here are some more websites to get free games from, assuming you know how. If not, here is how:

USA


This one should work with usa.


1. Head on over to http://www.gamemine.com/
2. Sign up for a free trial. VCC may work with some websites, others not.
3. Order the games you want.
4. When the games come leave it a couple of days.
5. Return to GameMine and open a case against the ordered items on the games you want to keep.
6. Put them as not received
7. Enjoy the games.
8. Cancel your GameMine free trial to avoid being charged the next month.

Use these websites for the following countries - 

USA - www.gamemine.com (Be aware, website is having problems at this time)
