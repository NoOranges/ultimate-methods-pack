I did this with an Apple iPad 2 box, because Apple sent me 3.

Excuses to get the Apple Box:
~This is the only time that I can come into UPS, but I have not had time to backup and copy all my contacts to my replacement phone, what should I do?
~I am on a very tight schedule today, and this is the only 10 minutes I could get away from a conference, could I get a box or something so I can send it in later? The iPhone still works, but the battery sucks, and I need it for my presentation later on today
~I'm on holiday right now, so I can't go to a UPS store, would it be possible if you send a box or bag to my house so when I get home, I can send it in?

It's not an overly complicated method, because many people already know the box method, but I guess it helps the newbies coming to astroPID
