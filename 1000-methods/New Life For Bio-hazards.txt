  Hey, As many of you know most companies have been raped in every possible way by the Bio-Hazard method. I'm going to tell you how to cleverly put a twist on it and get your way with the company.
 
1.) First, you're going to either want to find a product (should be electronic), and search some serials up for it. Once in a while you will get a product that covers "Accidental Damage and Spills". Snatch the serial and ring up the company. Get your rep into a situation where they are talking about your warranty and tell them how you were at work and you were using the "insert product". Describe to them how you work with dangerous chemicals for a living or other Bio hazard and the laptop was exposed to the it and it's broken and had to be disposed for safety or put away. The bio-hazard is dangerous to any person without proper equipment and it's illegal to ship via a courier. The spills warranty will cover it so preferably it should be a liquid spilt on it. The rep might bitch around, just get a supervisor since they actually know what a dangerous chemical is. They will replace it and you will be happy with you new product. 

2.) This way is similar to #2 in the way it was damaged by a liquid and can't be repaired because it's a dangerous chemical (bio-hazard). BUT this time you should buy something off of a namebrand website that doesn't advertise third party "liquid spill companies" like amazon (third party have a lesser chance of giving it to you, plus they are small usually). Next preform the things from (1.). 

*amazons spills and damage company has not been tested but will probably work.
*You may possibly .00001% need to provide fake employment info (i never did) if you say it was at work, maybe say it happened at home in your meth lab. 
*DON'T ABUSE SMALL INSURANCE COMPANIES 

GOOD LUCK
