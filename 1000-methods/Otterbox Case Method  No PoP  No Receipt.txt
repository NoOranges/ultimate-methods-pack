Hello all! This is a method for getting an Otterbox Case without any proof of purchase or receipt.

This method was done in Canada with an iPhone 4s Reflex case, I cannot guarantee it will work with any other cases/countries. 

Important: Try to do this near their closing time, as well as while they are busy with calls.

Step 1: Call up Otterbox at 855-688-7269. To be routed to technical support press 2 when prompted and then on the next menu press 4.

Step 2: Talk to the rep, be friendly, but if they seem hesitant also act frustrated. Tell them that you recently purchased an Otterbox case for your iPhone and the silicone is tearing off (tell them a specific location on the case that it is coming off of, I used the silicone around the iPhone button).

Step 3: They may ask you where you had purchased the case, say Amazon. They will tell you that you require a replacement and ask for your address and email. They will say that they will send out a confirmation email after you hang up the phone.

Step 4: That's it! Enjoy your new Otterbox case!


Advanced steps if the confirmation email asks for PoP or a receipt:

In the event that the confirmation email asks for PoP or receipt, just ignore the email and call up Otterbox again about 10 minutes later. It does not matter what rep you get, say that you did not receive the confirmation email and you suspect they may have entered it incorrectly. They will say that there is nothing they can do about the email that was sent but they can update the email for next time. Give them a new email, and since they cannot resend the old email, they will tell you that you are good to go and that your package will arrive in X amount of days.

That's it!
