So I just came across this while browsing some forums. Basically Apple settled with this company because of their iPhone 4 antenna issue. If you complete this form you get $15 in the mail. All you need to do is print out the form, write down the serial you've generated and input it on the form. Scan it to your PC and upload it here: https://www.iphone4settlement.com/CAClaimForms/AIF/SupportingDocUpload.aspx
