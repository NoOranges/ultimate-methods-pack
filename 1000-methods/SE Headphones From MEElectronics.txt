First, find some headphones you want to SE from meelec.com.

Now, whip up a quick fake Amazon receipt using Photoshop or one of those generators. The trick is to make it appear as if you've only had the headphones for less than a couple weeks.

Then hit up their customer service over at customerservice@meelec.com and send them an email with something like this:

I have had these xxxxxxx headphones for exactly 1 week and they are  already defective. If I move to cord slightly, the sound goes out. This  is not my first pair of MEElectronic headphones that have broken.

How can I get a replacement? I already contacted Amazon and they said to  contact you. I paid $XXX for these! I have attached my Amazon.com  receipt.

Thank you.

Make sure you come up with your own story or tweak that one a bit.

They'll reply with something like "since you've only had these headphones for X week(s), we'll do an advanced replacement. Can we confirm your address?"

Confirm your address with them and then they'll send you your pair in the mail. They'll want the defective pair back, but they haven't contacted me for them. You can just tell them that you already sent it, etc. and I guess they'll leave you alone.

MEElectronics is not the biggest company in the world so if this becomes saturated quickly, I'm sorry.

Enjoy! :act-up:
