I have an ATM hack for Triton/Tranax machines (the shitty independent, free standing ones you find in newsagents etc.)

Now I'm not sure where I got it or how it came to be in my possession.
It may even have been written by someone on Astro.
So just so we are clear...I didn't write this.
I have used it once. I emptied the machine of around £200 in £10 notes.
It doesn't work on all of them but it is handy knowledge to have if you see one of these machines.

If you would like it... PM me.
If I don't reply...you ain't getting it...please don't beg.
If you send me a method you are far more likely to get it.

Peace out.

EDIT: I'm pretty sure these machines are in the US and UK as well as other countries.
