Hey, this is my first tut, and i hope you enjoy it ;)
First step:
Buy fake Dr. Dre Beats somewhere (made in china, ebay...).
Make sure they look as real as possible like the real ones.
Second step: 
Go to a local store where they sell Dr. Dre Beats, and tell them you want to give it back (gift for a friend who dont likes it, be creative!)
(look for young employees, they will do it the most time)
Third Step:
They should ask you for a receipt, as you dont have one, they will give possibly store credit.
Last Step:
Go and buy the real ones with your credit ;)



PS:
The method may be better if you actually buy the beats first, switch the boxes between the fake so the real box has the fake ones in then get a refund.
Better idea, buy fake beats, email monstercable saying you bought fake beats from bestbuy, send them in, get real beats.
Have fun :D
