This method was adapted from what I found earlier today, it is available in the US only. Following this guide will guarantee you a gift card but please remember the most expensive the card you want the less chance you will succeed.

1. Create a receipt, the receipt has to be addressed to domino's pizza, find a store in a different town to ensure they cannot check what the receipts look like.

2. Call this number 734-930-3030 (Customer Support)

3. Say you received it as a gift but it never arrived, you lost it on the beach, you ate it thinking it was domino's. Just some story that you can make up. Be sure to know what store you got it from!

4. Provide them with the Proof of Purchase, this will prove to them you have bought the Gift Card.

5. If successful you will get your card in the post no longer than a week after they confirm there shipping.

This guide was adapted by me using this piece of informtion;

Domino's Pizza cannot be responsible for lost or stolen cards, however, if you have proof of purchase call 734-930-3030 for assistance.
