Xbox as of 27th of November
 
Any orders cancelled from Monday 25th to today are due to them changing the Advance replacement policy, and in that case you can submit a new request through the website on the same account without a problem.
 
Changes: Now they will not send full bundles period console only, this is due to an influx of orders however all consoles are not refubs and are in fact new.

Therefore in theory you can add a $36 USD card and it should go through.
 
Finally free games:
 
How to rape them for free games, add a $1 VCC ar with an xbox. (Order will be cancelled within 2 days)
However you can go to chat and ask about the deal for the free game for affected users and they will provide the dlc
