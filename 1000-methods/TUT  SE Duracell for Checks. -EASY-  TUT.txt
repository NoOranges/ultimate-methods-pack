I have not seen a tut on Duracell in the Premium area. I hope I don't get in trouble for this lulz. If I posted it in the Premium area, no would even notice it, so I posted it here.

Step 1
Go to http://pg.custhelp.com/app/ask

Step 2
Tell them, your Duracell Batteries basically fucked up your 90$ gaming mouse./100$ keyboard/ w.e you want PLEASE USE SOMETHING OTHER THEN MOUSES.
I suggest looking at the my pic to understand it.
Example :

NOTE : Do not use my story, that was just a example.

Step 3
Wait for a email, when you get it, it should look like this.

Done.

I do not claim making this method. I am 100% sure that it is not in the premium area.
