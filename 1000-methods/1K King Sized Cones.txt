Simple and easy.

Contact Jware 
email: s a l e s @ j w a r e . o r g
skype: jware.org
Tell them that you had bought, (or received as a gift if they want an order number or tell you to talk to amazon) a box of 1,000 of their King sized (Or any size you want) cones.
Say that they were britle, cracked, and broke apart right away, and were a complete waste, so you ended up tossing them.   
They should email you back saying sorry, have a free box on us.
Give them your address.
Wait.
Receive 1K of cones.
Never have to buy papers again.

I did this a month or two back, They didn't ask for a POP, or anything. As long as you guys don't rape the shit out of them, I think everyone will be able to get their free cones.
