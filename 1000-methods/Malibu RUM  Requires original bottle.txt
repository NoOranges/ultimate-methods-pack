1. Contact them via there website saying it taste horrible and that you can't even describe how disgusting this taste compared to how it usually taste and that something must have been wrong with this bottle.

2. They will reply asking for lot number, physical address, bottle size and phone number.

I know, not very impressive but my girlfriend loves this stuff so I figured, why not.
