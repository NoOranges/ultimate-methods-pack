This works succesfully for,

BT Openzone
BT Fon

Requires small investment - Good for holidays/any time you need a hotspot/airports etc

----------------------------------------------

1. Purchase a 1day thing for one of the BT net works above, if you can connect to them like 80% of the UK can.

2. Connect, and use it, when its like 90% used, call them up, you can find there number on there website, and say the internet keeps disconnecting, or you can't connect for nearly an hour now.

3. They will give you another day.

4. I done this for 2 weeks straight when my internet was down, the rep just kept handing over them free days!

- They do not log the free gift days, so you can literally rinse and repeat this, over and over and over.

Till it dies.

Feel free to rape this.
