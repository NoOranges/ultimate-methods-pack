Ok guys to start off id like to apologise to N3wb Hacker for potentially ruining is service, But he seems like a nice guy so if you cant be bothered using this then buy off him hes extremely cheap!

Right, this isnt a SE of such all you need is a vcc  with one dollar on it or in some cases they dont even charge the card :p This whole thing is a common service used by glasses company's to get their customers to try out frames that they like its called "home try on" You usually get 4,5 or even 6 frames to try on but obviously your supposed to return them ;) 

Anyways do what you like with the company's, i haven't done it , or i dont even plan to its just nice to give something back sometimes :)

http://www.fetcheyewear.com/customer/try-at-home <-- 125$ hold may appear on statement ( 6 pairs though)

http://www.baileynelson.com.au/ <-- for all you crazy Australians, 5$ hold

https://www.glassesdirect.co.uk/purchase/ <-- For the british cunts ;) apparently no hold they just take the info

http://www.sneakingduck.com/tryathome <-- another aussie brand, not sure of the hold

http://eyesright.co.uk/ <-- Uk site also not sure of hold i think its 3.95 per pair


Sadly no irish sites to take advantage of :( But for uk, aus and us people your in luck :) If anyone thinks this should be moved to a higher tier or lower just pm me.
