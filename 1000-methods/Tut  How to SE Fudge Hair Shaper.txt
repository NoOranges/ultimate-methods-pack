Just a quick review before I go onto how to SE Fudge Hair Shaper, This stuff is amazing it smells nice and is decently strong. IT'S A CREME NOT GEL!

Right, To SE this product you will only need a batch number which I can supply one, 0J224 but after a load of tries they may become suspicious so you may want to find another batch number by just going to your local shop and looking on the bottom of the "Fudge Hair Shaper Original 75g Tub" (In black writing). I'm not sure where the other batch numbers are located on the other products but can be found out easily. Now just go to their contact page and fill in your info and complain about it. Use your imagination to think up a problem with the product. Then they will send you out a new tub, I received a 100g version and a bag, yes that's right a free bag as well!
