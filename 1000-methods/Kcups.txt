You can go about this a billion ways, I am only posting this because someone requested it.

You can say...

1. The kcups you ordered taste disgusting and you have tried this same flavor before and it was great, you don't understand what happened, they will offer you a replacement.

2. Say you ordered some kcups from amazon over a month ago, you just opened the box and noticed your kcups were punctured and you are unsure if you should use them. They will offer you replacements.
