Hello, welcome to my guide about how to find serials!
Today, I'm going to show you how to find serials for free.

Method 1
First of all, I would like to introduce the best website on the internet. Head over to:
http://www.google.com/
If you don't know what it looks like, it looks like this:

Second, you are going to want to click that little text field. Type as follows:
"name of your product" serial
(quotes included)
just like this for example:
http://gyazo.com/9f31899602ecdd381b5326de9f5aafff.png?1357954147
If you want better results, you can include (without quotes) "picture", "guide", "algorithm" (*I don't think you would find anything using this), "unboxing", "ebay", "craigslist", "kijiji", "waranty"

Press the big "Google Search" button, and let the magic begin.............

Now you have 2 options.....
Option 1:
You can go and press "images", and it will lead you to the images google has found.
example:
http://gyazo.com/be957e99eaf25e60a7639f3e76add488.png?1357954269

Now, you need to look at every picture here. Usually you would find some serials that are used, blurred out, or they might work!
If you scroll down enough, you would find a serial like this:
http://www.freeimage.us/thumb-7DA7_4D9F412B.jpg (zoom in to see the serial, if you are lazy it is 156989703505)

Once you find one, try it. You may need to dig deep, but you may eventually find one.

Option 2:
You can continue using the text search.
You would need to browse through pages upon pages until you find something.
I don't recommend this one because it does take awhile and I rarely found a serial this way.

Method 2:
You can use these 3 websites to help find you serials:
www.kijiji.ca/
http://gyazo.com/891bff4485c2e115f2249de8e3ecba68.png?1357954829
http://craigslist.ca
http://gyazo.com/b2e59e6fac12fdf3db32f6d29775a7f8.png?1357954887
http://ebay.com/

http://gyazo.com/ac2ca7ff16d3d5c1810484c03c877b4e.png?1357954927

http://craigslist.ca/

http://gyazo.com/b42790f24c74f946c107b916b247fb07.png?1357955823
You can use any of these sites, they pretty much look the same way.
There are 2 options you can do


Option 1:

For this example, I'm going to be using kijiji.
First, you are going to want to search up your product. Just type it in without quotes, and include serial at the end.
http://gyazo.com/15de75d3ba97cd2ad88f1379a1bbc3ae.png?1357955021

You won't get many results. Click the product that you see, and you need to look around in the pictures, as well as in the description for the serial. In this case, this person gave a picture of their serial (blocked it out, and they removed it right after I refreshed)
http://gyazo.com/53dc9af70d2e9b9d4d3399a879449e3e.png?1357955201
There, you can get the serial, nice and easy. This does take some time, and if you can't find it on 1 site, then try another. 


Option 2:

This is the most common one. You can use other selling sites, but the 3 I gave up there I recommend for this.

First, you are going to find the product you would like to find. I chose this one:
http://mujura.net/i/images/190648a369df524e9f7cb113016672eff50126.png
Email them and say something like this (minus the "I want to SE this part)
http://gyazo.com/f6b6446898988582a7f97616e56a9cc9.png?1357955618
After that, they will probably send you the serial. Remember to be descriptive as possible, because it will answer some questions they might have.
This usually works, but send it to some other people, because not all people send it.

Thank you for reading my guide, I know I used a lot of pictures.
