Tell them you have had it for around 3months and yesterday it started  acting up, you went through all the trouble shooting methods on the  website and it was no help.


what 'said' problem is:
your playing xbox live and you get disconnected after a few hours of  game time the led on the adapter flashes red and you can't reconnect.  you turn the xbox off and wait a few minutes and turn it back on and it  works again.


They will offer to pick yours up then send you a new one , refuse this  tell them that you have gone through this before and it was 6weeks  before you got your replacement!!! you cannot go that long without xbox  live and it's not completely broken.

They will bitch at you go ahead and bitch and moan emphasising the long wait and they fact that it's not completely broken.


After a few minutes they will cave and 'make a one of exception and go  against policy' at this point it can go two ways they might replace it  out right or do an advance replacement, they don't request a CC or  anything and don't chase up if you don't send it in.



Notes: (will update if needed)
They may ask for proof of purchase say you binned it that's why you  didn't go back to the store, the shouldn't care and proceed with your  case.
They don't usually chase up replacements but if they call say your mum  binned it by accident or you shipped it in via usps or royal mail and  should be with them soon.
 
Be creative and you can get almost any product from Microsoft.
