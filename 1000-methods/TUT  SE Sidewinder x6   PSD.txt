My name is ****** and I would help you with SideWinder X6 Keyboard issue.   

 

According to your description I understand that, keyboard does not work as expected and you have tried it on different computer with no success. Please let me know if this information is accurate.

 

I understand the inconvenience you are experiencing. Please be assured that I will try my best to help you resolve the issue.

 

Carlos, to provide you the replacement and set the warranty date, you must provide a copy of the purchase receipt which clearly indicates the date of sale and the name and address of the store from which the device was purchased, as well as the screenshot of back of the keyboard showing the Serial Number as well as the Product ID (P/N). 

Note: The following items are unacceptable items as proof of purchase: Text documents, Bank or credit card statements, hand-written receipts, and statement from eBay, Amazon Marketplace, or other non-retail forms of evidence.

You can send your proof of purchase and the screenshot of back of the keyboard displaying the Product and Serial Number by simply responding to this email with the items requested. Please follow the instructions below:

1. If you have access to a scanner, scan the receipt. You can also use the camera on your mobile phone or a standard digital camera to take a picture of the receipt as well as the back of your keyboard where the PID is listed. Both the receipt and the screenshot of the back of your keyboard are required and the numbers must be clear on files. If you purchased online, a screenshot of the receipt will suffice.

2. Respond directly to this email, including your attachments (the purchase receipt file as well as screenshots). Please note that you must respond to this email for us to proceed with warranty validation. If you do not use the reply option to this email we will be unable to relate your response to your service request and your resolution will be delayed.

3. With the information also include the Product ID (P/N) located on the bottom of the device.

4. Ensure the file (attachment) is less than 1 megabyte in size. If your file is larger, your mail may be rejected by our system.

5. Send your attachment in JPG, GIF, or TIF format. This minimizes the file size, and also ensures that we can open your file successfully.

We will monitor your service request for your response. If we do not receive a response within ten (10) business days, we assume that you no longer need help and the incident will be closed.

Should you have any other questions or if you need further assistance regarding this issue, please do not hesitate to contact us again by replying directly to this e-mail.
