This company has contracts with high level people. DO NOT attempt this if you don't know what you are doing. I DO NOT recommend doing this without having a drop house and a bit of guts.  

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

IronKey is the brand name for the family of secure portable data storage and mobile workspace solutions offered by Imation Corp., a global scalable storage and data security company.
From 2005-2012, IronKey was an Internet security and privacy company based in California. IronKey's founding was partially funded by the U.S. federal government, with a grant of US$1.4 million through the Homeland Security Research Projects Agency, and their products have been used extensively by the U.S. government in various areas.In September 2011, Imation acquired the IronKey secure storage hardware business and brought into Imation the team that designed and developed the IronKey secure USB drives. In October 2012, the former IronKey company rebranded itself as Marble Security, and the IronKey brand became wholly owned by Imation.

As part of Imation, the IronKey portfolio now includes products and intellectual property from the former IronKey, as well as technologies from Imation acquisitions of MXI Security and ENCRYPTX.
The IronKey secure data storage and mobile workspace product family protects organizations against data loss and supports compliance strategies, provides users secure and convenient access to their data and applications wherever they are, and delivers managed security over a range of USB devices and removable media.
