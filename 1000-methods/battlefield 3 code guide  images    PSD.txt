1. Download the PSD

Open the PSD will contain the blank image, date text and code text.

2. Google Wood Flooring change option to Large images and pick a suitable Pic. Create a new Layer place below the code image and resize the flooring image.

5. Copy the image and paste it in photoshop on a new layer, Either use the magic wand to remove the white around it or simply using the pen tool on 2-3px and write over the signture.

Use the txt file in the PSD for the date or simply again freehand it using the pen tool.


4. I would then suggest New Layer > Image Apply Image > Filter Blur Gassion Blue 0.2/.3 px to make it looks a little bit blurry as taken by a camera.

and the finish product.
