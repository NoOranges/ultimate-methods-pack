This is really simple.

We are going to be using a Kindle for an example. The following like shows what the code means:
http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/Kindle_Serial_Numbers

So now find the code of the model you want i am going to use 
B0C9 this is for a Kindle Fire HD 8.9" 16GB

now goto Google.com and type intext:"B0C9" or change "B0C9" into the model you are looking for.

So you will get lots of random trash in the search like bellow

So lets narrow it down to what we really want so go to the Google Search box and add "Kindle" to it and you will have something like bellow

and now you see some SN's for Kindles.

Yes i know that you may not get vary many SN's but this helps gather some PIDs and then you can try to make some type of generator.
