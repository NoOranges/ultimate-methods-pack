This method was tested about a month ago and it worked. This SE was in parts so you won't actually get the whole sink unless you can come up with some reason with why everything doesn't work. You don't have to send anything back in, or at least I didn't have to.

Just to clear something up. You don't actually get a "sink", you get a faucet and its accessories(if applicable).

I'm not going to really go into detail, but anyways lets get started.

Steps:
1. Head over to Pfister.com and look for a sink/faucet that you like (preferably a cheaper model, mines costed about $200). Get all the information for that sink/faucet; Model; series; product finish; etc (you shouldn't need help doing this being as this is the VIP section, we all should know what we're doing by now).
2. Contact there support forum. It's easy to find. Click here
3. Click on 'contact us' under 'ask a question'.
4. Now you will have to choose a option from the drop down box, I chose 'General'.
5. Now you will have to fill out the information; model; series; name; inquiry; etc. Pretty self explanatory stuff. Make sure you input the address you want it sent to as they will just send you a replacement.
6. Then write down your problem. I just told them my sink was leaking blah blah blah. I then receive an email stating I will be receiving replacement parts. 

Everything came in parts but it worked. Hell I received the faucet by itself first, and then just was like "whatever", but then days later more parts started arriving. 

Done. Pretty easy SE. I can't verify that this still works. I would have posted it once I found it but I wasn't apart of Astro at the time. 

Proof you say?
