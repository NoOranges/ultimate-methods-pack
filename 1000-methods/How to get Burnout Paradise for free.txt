I saw a post on HF giving the coupon code PARADISE for Burnout Paradise. The problem was that I live in the US and really wanted that game. I finally found a proxy that works and here is the site http://www.expatshield.com/ . Make when you activate the proxy that you log out of Origin and log back in when it's activated. If this is in the wrong section please let me know / move it. Enjoy!
