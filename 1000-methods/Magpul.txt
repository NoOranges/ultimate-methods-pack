Now you too can look like a tacitcool idiot at the range

Pick your magpul crap (http://store.magpul.com/product/MAG414/88)
Select your contact method (Phone = 877-462-4785 email = orders@magpul.com)
Tell them about the crack in your <insert shitty plastic gun part> out of the box
They will ask for that POP
Use generic receipt template and throw on the name of a local gunshop
They may or may not ask for it back

If they ask for it back
You are an elite spechul furces uperatur and you are being to deployed to <REDACTED FOR SECURITY> and you dont have time for the post office
OR box it


Wait a little bit
Enjoy your plastic gun part (sometimes they even include magpul stickers :O)
