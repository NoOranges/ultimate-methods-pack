Find an item that Amazon sells cheaper than Walmart. Lets say its a set of headlights for a car. Buy the headlights for $150 from Amazon, show up at Walmart, say you need to return them but lost your receipt, and they'll take them back and give you $200. I did this a few months ago and got a store credit. Unfortunately, Walmart is a one hour round trip for me, so I won't be doing it again anytime soon. 

Remember, don't rape this and it'll work for ages.
