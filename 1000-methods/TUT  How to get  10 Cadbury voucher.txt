Anyone who is in the UK, this tut is for you. Cadbury makes damn nice chocolate, so I thought...hey lets give this a try. Here is the method I used.

1. Go to the Cadbury feedback website and fill out the form. Ensure you say you purchased at least 4 large bars, and find some excuse. It's a lot easier if it is likely something to do with the retailer, e.g it was deformed as if it was melted. They often require a lot more information if it seems to be a manufacturing problem.

2. Wait a few days, and then in the post you will get a Cadbury voucher (they don't contact you through email). That simple ;)
