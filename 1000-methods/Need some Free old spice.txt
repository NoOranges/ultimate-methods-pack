Just did this last week.

Go to:
http://www.oldspice.com/products/by-type/fragrance/

and pick out want you want to SE
I only tried it with the fragrances because I already had one at home and i didn't know if you'd need the code on the bottom (Turns out, you don't) but you could try it with anything from old spice.

Then you go to their contact page
http://pg.custhelp.com/app/ask/p/30/session/L3NpZC9EdlFqQnh2aw%3D%3D

Fill out all you're legit info (or fake info for a drop if you really want..)
You don't need a UPC or Production code, so just leave that blank.

Just say it was bad, it burned, it smelled like skunk, blah blah blah ect ect.
They'll email you saying something like this

Email them back with you're address

And then a week later, I got a letter in the mail from P&G and old spice saying sorry for the low quality and stuff, and a manufacturer's coupon on the back for a free bottle of Old spice cologne or aftershave. I'll just pick mine up next time I"m at the store.

I'll post pics of the letter and coupon later.

Not super rewarding, but for sending 2 emails, it saves you $20 on a bottle of aftershave/cologne.
