Haven't seen a method posted in public, no clue if there is one in VIP so no hating alright!!

Requirements:
-Serial number (Can be obtained via ebay, craigslist, gumtree, other members)

- A brain

1. First thing is first, go to the jawbone jambox support and go to the contact page: https://jawbone.com/contact

You can do live chat or email on there, both will require the serial number for whatever version of the jawbox you wish to SE

2. Now you want to say whatever is wrong with it e.g no sound, won't turn on etc. Go through all troubleshooting steps and they will offer a replacement, but! they will require you sending it in first. This can be dealt with, you can box them if you like or did what I did, not send it at all, leave it a week and say you have sent it and there has been no update.

3. you should receive an email saying a replacement is being sent out and you will then get tracking

4. new jambox comes in a few days and there you go! but you only get the speaker, nothing else so if you go for the big jambox I would highly recommend getting a wall charger from them as it takes a while to charge from USB power, this can be done easily through chat, just said you sent the charger too and thought the replacement came with one.

5. Now play music and enjoy your jambox!!
