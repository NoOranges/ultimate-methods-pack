Tell them your Macbook pro is not turning on.
They will ask for the serial give the one you registered and they will confirm it&#8217;s a macbook pro and so on.
They will do troubleshooting steps simply pretend your doing them and none work mention how you were reading there terms and it says that its considered Dead On Arrival.
They will then ask where you purchased the computer, Say you got it from someone but they bought it at the Apple store.
They will say you need to take it to the apple store.
Simply give them a reason of why your not able to get there a good suggestion would be:
"I am in a wheel chair, My leg is broke, I have a really bad back I&#8217;m not suppose to be moving around a lot with, I have a tumour (WORKS LOL)..You be leaving for work/school within two weeks and need your Mac with you.
They should check with there supervisor or they should just offer a few options for replacement
There options should be to Send it in, Take it to an Apple store&#8221;, or &#8220; Rapid Replacement &#8220;
If they don&#8217;t offer the Rapid replacement ask them if there&#8217;s a way you can as you need it fast as possible and it will be more convient. If they say there isn&#8217;t a way, demand a manager.
and say are you sure and stuff like that basically beg them. You should eventually be able to be setup for the Rapid replacement or cross shipping
They ask your address, name, postal/zip code, city, province, country, credit card details give them all to them
Receive a box, tamper with it, send it back, as soon as the label is scanned, you will receive your brand new Macbook.


I do not condone the acts of social engineering. This is for educational purposes only
Also, this still works. Maybe not word for word, but I know for a 100% fact it does.

There ya have it folks. Will probably be the last thread of mine, definitely the last method. My leaving gift to you. Didnt feel like asking the other thread to be moved astroastroastroastro swag suk my dik staffz.. 

Also, before any of you guys say "blah blah blah this is already know im gay i know this method this is know regular doa method".. I made this method months ago, around the same time Popc0rns came out without knowing his. This dates back to around May or June.
