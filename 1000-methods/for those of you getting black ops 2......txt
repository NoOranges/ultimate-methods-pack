i did this a long time ago because i dropped the disc right after i got it and it cracked......... don't know if this still works but it should.


Go to Gamestop or whatever and buy your BRAND NEW; SEALED GAME. Go outside make sure nobody sees you. open up the case and take the disc out and hide it. go back to the store and tell them the case had no disc inside. get a new copy.
