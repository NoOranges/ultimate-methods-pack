I just failed an exam that I've sat twice now. I need to pass it to get ahead in my job.

I am writing this without testing it...I've formulated a plan that I'm sure will work just haven't had the opportunity to use it yet.

You'll need. 

1 x iPhone/ smartphone
Streaming app
4 x Cheap Mobile Phones
4 x telephone numbers corresponding to these handsets.
Gaffer Tape
A friend and their mobile.
The internet
Balls

Tape each cellphone to each limb and agree on which limb is which answer.(A, B, C, D each have a phone number

Tape your smartphone with the streaming app running to your chest and open your shirt a bit so your friend can see your screen / paper (you'll have to work on alignment beforehand so I suggest a few test runs)

I'm bored of typing...if you haven;t figured it out from this ^^^^ You are an official spastic and should go jump off a bridge!

Love to all xxx
