Attain the serial of any Philip's shaver, does not have to be of the model you want.
Go to Philip's support chat here.
Scroll down to "Men's Grooming / Norelco" and click on "Chat 24/7."
Begin shmoozing with the rep. Make up an excuse about how your shaver no longer turns on and how you have tried charging it for the past few hours and it still doesn't work.
They will eventually give in and at this point will tell you to email them at a certain address with a receipt.
Finally just send a fake receipt and PROFIT!!
