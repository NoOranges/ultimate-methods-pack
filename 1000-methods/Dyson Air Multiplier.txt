Ok, So you know those cool (and Expensive) Air Multipliers that Dyson started selling earlier this year? Well here is how you can get one. The model i will be helping you on is the AM01 Table Fan 10 inch, White and Blue.

You will need a SN:

White SN Algorithm (Click Here to See):

X = Random Number
KA3-US-BDAXXXXA

Example: KA3-US-BDA1234A
 
Blue SN Algorithm (Click Here to See):

X = Random Number
KP9-US-EBAXXXXA

Example: KP9-US-EBA1234A

You May or May not need to make a fake persona... If you do you can use;

Ok, Now we need a good receipt (Make sure the place sells the Dyson's) :
I recommend my Digital Multi-Receipt Generator(Open Source).
Make sure to add a few other items to the receipt to make it look more realistic. 

Ok next step it Registering the Dyson:

Make the date bought be a few months ago... not just 30 days after.
