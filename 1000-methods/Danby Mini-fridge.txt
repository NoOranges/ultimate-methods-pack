So I meant to post this a while back but I totally forgot about this SE, the company, etc.. Recently someone reminded me about this fridge I had gotten as they asked if anyone knew any good fridge company to SE. So I went looking through me e-mail history and I just recently found two of the emails which led me to the company, so here it is. 

Simple method, nothing to it. Just your unit sucked and they replace it. I believe this company is rather small too so I don't know how many reps they have. My rep was a rep named Emma so since the bitches love me it was easy. Just a simple email and she asked for PoP to replace. 

What you will need:

Receipt - A simple generated one will do. But like I always say in some of my threads,  I wouldn't use one from Amazon as most companies now verify with Amazon before continuing their replacement process. If it helps I edited  (same one I always edit) a eBay invoice I received from a seller and it worked great.
 
The invoice must contain purchase price, name of dealer, date of purchase (a couple weeks back) and description of product (model number/name of the product).

We need to have a document with the purchase price, name of dealer, date of purchase and description of the product.
Otherwise we cannot help you under warranty.


Do your homework on fridges - This can help you come up with an excuse as to why your fridge sucked. Mines was as simple as saying it was dead; didn't turn on. 

Serial (might not be needed) - I never needed or was asked for it but they might ask some for it. 

Model number - Easy to get just get off Amazon being as I recommend you go to Amazon as the first step anyways. 

Steps:

1. Head to Amazon and look up 'Danby'. Find the fridge/product you want. 

2. Now e-mail Danby at consumers@danby.com (not sure if that works for other countries). In the message let them know of something that is wrong with your fridge. Depending on what product you chose to get the problem with that said fridge can vary. The most common problem like any other product is it stop powering on/working/freezing shit. 


3. You will get a reply, and depending on your rep you might just be asked for PoP and then asked for your information to replace. But you might get asked to run some troubleshooting steps first. Just treat it like any other SE and say you have and nothing has worked. You will eventually get a replacement sent to you. 

I suggest you get your PoP ready before contacting them. They might ask for PoP before continuing just to insure you are covered under warranty. 

4. Get to the point they give you your replacement and enjoy. And obviously come up with a reason why you can't wait, if they ask you to ship it in for repair (they shouldn't). A good excuse is that you are heading out for college soon, as college season is right around the corner. 

It's easy as just saying your fridge doesn't work. But to clarify for those who wonder how you go from e-mailing to replacement. Contact them, tell them your product doesn't work, they will ask you to do some steps, they will ask for PoP, they ask for your information to ship the new fridge to.

I can not say this worked for all Danby products or that it works outside of the US. The product I got retailed for about $230 (which sold for $180 very quirky) so as far as I know the max amount is $230 without them wanting more information or for you to send it in first (some companies use different methods depending on cost of product; cheaper is quicker, expensive is harder). I also can't say you will be able to rape this. This has worked 100% for me but then again I only tried once. 
 
Keep in mind I did do this about 1 month ago so their policy could have changed.
 
Also they are a small company, well at least they have small amount of reps it seems like so get it while you can. That's why I posted this right now (in the morning/AM) so those who can get there e-mails in can possibly get a replacement send out later on today.

Remember: If this stops working for this company just go on Amazon, look up mini-fridge, get the manufacturer/company do a decent fridge, and apply this to that company. It will work most of the time especially to a rather small company.
