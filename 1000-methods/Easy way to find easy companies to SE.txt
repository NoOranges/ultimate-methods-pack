Here's a small tip on how to find companies that can be SE'd. These companies will mainly be small companies, but that just means they are easier to SE as they haven't been raped... yet. 

Nothing special here but a small tip so don't expect a method or anything like that. Just a small way you can get to companies that haven't been touched... yet. 

Some people may already do this some may not. Whatevs'. This is for the niqqas who didn't think about doing this or just plain didn't know doing this could help. 

Anyways lets start this bad boy out 

1. Head to Amazon.com or any other online merchant. 

2. Search for the product you want not the item. 

This won't really work if you search for an item that is specifically tied to one company. For ex - searching "iPod Touch" won't work as its tied to Apple and you can only go through them.

Instead for the product itself. For ex - instead of iPod Touch search for "music player". 

3. You should then get a list of products. Of course Apple products or any other top music player company would be on top. What you should then do is scroll down, or go over a few pages until you start seeing unheard of companies. Maybe not unheard of but small companies. 

Just write the company's name down. 

4. Look for that company's website and contact information. Now just contact them. 

5. Done.

This is only for electronics. It can work for other products such as fans, guns (bb or paint), heaters, microwaves, etc.. 

Finding small companies is key. Reason being is because these smaller companies don't have the luxury of just fucking people over like bigger companies so they will back their product up the fullest extend. Most will even send you a replacement first. And most of the time all they require is a receipt. Just make one, send it, and receive your product. Simple. 

Watch out for companies that are too small and only sell items on Amazon because when going about a replacement they will require an Amazon order number, which isn't really useful unless you have access to Amazon order numbers/accounts but if you have that why not just request a replacement/refund?

Now remember since you are looking for small companies that products (most of the time) won't be something fancy and expensive like shit sold by Apple, DELL, etc., but it will be something nice.

This technique has been used for like 30% of my methods/companies. I've released a few of them, but now I'll give you guys the chance to look up some newer companies and release a tut?
