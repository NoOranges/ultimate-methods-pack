1. Select your iTunes Gift Card. Choose the value.
2. Find a lone line and while in the line write the code from the card down on your phone(pretend you're texting) and make sure no cameras are near you.
3.When asked to pay for the item say you have forgotten your card/money or that you don't have enough money, ask them to hold the item for you while you run and get your wallet.
4. Make sure hat they scan the card before so you know it's activated.
5. Once you've left use the code.

The best thing is if you use a self-scanner
