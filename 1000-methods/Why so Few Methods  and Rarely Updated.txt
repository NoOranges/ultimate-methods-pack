Alright, so I paid for VIP expecting to get a couple good methods, but once I got here I found that these had all been methods that had been leaked so many times, and that I had seen on HF. Supposedly they're plenty of methods for premium, but I don't see why there is only 1 method added per week at most. Does anyone else feel a little bit ripped off?
