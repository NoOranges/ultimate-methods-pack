dont say i leaked this because i am shappa, i just need to change my name on this site

these little machines make great gifts for younger siblings or others. they are also quite easy to SE. 

what your going to do is call them up at 1-903-453-0804 and say that your bug stopped working. they will sound shocked and ask for your address.

it is really that easy. this is an original method by shappa, dont leak mothafuckas ;)
