Hey guys, here's how to get yourselves a myCharge Freedom 2000 Power Case for iPhone 5.

A Freedom 2000 case is supposed to give you up to 9 hours of talk time for your iPhone 5. It has an 2000mAh Lithium Polymer battery that gives you twice as much battery life.

Tell them a problem that can't be fixed that is the manufacturer's fault. Be creative, don't be stupid.


Example of one: *******don't copy this, make up your own******* The case took a charge but wouldn't transfer the charge to the phone. I was going to purchase this, review it on YouTube, and recommend it, but can't do either due to it not working. Help me out here. *******don't copy this, make up your own*******


They will ask for a receipt and most likely pictures (they did with me, so I just said I couldn't find the receipt and I sent them a few pictures I got off the internet with my name attached.)


Some pictures at your disposal:

They may ask you to send it back, so just make up a story as to why you can't do it. Biohazard probably doesn't work, I didn't even try it as I just told them I was on a business trip, and I would be headed to X location so they should ship it to me there. You can probably box them if they insist you send it back.


Notes: Remember to ask for a manager or supervisor if the rep is being uncooperative. Be polite. Use a drop? Just to be safe.


Enjoy!
