You can sell these hair clippers on eBay (SE them straight to buyer) and make a great profit. The clippers, trimmers, etc. are expensive as fuck; some go up to the $400's. 

This company is fairly easy.... oh and it's advance replacement. Just follow these steps: 

1. Contact them about any of their clippers. I contacted about their BGR+ wireless clippers. 

2. Let them know your shit isn't working. I told them mines wouldn't turn on/charge. 

3. Ask for speedy replacement cause you're a barber and need 'em for work. They will ask for PoP. 

4. Email them your fake PoP. I used a fake online invoice from Sears. 

5. In a few days you will receive an email stating they will be sending you a replacement with labels. 

6. Done.

Note; One rep told me they didn't offer such thing, so if one tells you no just hang up and call again.

Oh and I almost forgot.... the company is Andis.
