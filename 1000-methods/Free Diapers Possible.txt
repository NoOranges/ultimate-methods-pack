Well I actually got this method thanks to my 10 month old. My wife and I buy him diapers by the box which is really only 14-19 for a 96ct box.

1. go to the luvs contact page http://www.luvsdiapers.com/Contact-us and send them and email with your excuse. Mine was the fact that the pull tabs kept ripping off as I tried to put them on my son(truth in my case). Another thing you can say is that there were diapers  missing from the box etc etc etc...Think something up, your not idiots!!!

2. You will get an email back saying that they are very sorry for the inconvenience and they will be sending you some coupons for some free diapers, or they could say that they will be sending you a debit card as a refund and a good faith token.

3. Cover the babies butt with some free diapers.
