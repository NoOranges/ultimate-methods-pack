Well here's a simple way to get a somewhat good laptop. 

I am not really going to put where to go, how to find something, etc., just the basics. You can find the links, numbers, information on your own. 

This isn't very hard, although it works depends on your skills, and or sometimes the rep (if your skills are great, the rep isn't shiiiiit). 

I haven't done this in about a month that and me typing this in about 5 minutes may lead to the thread not being as detailed as I wish or me forgetting to add some things, but I will edit the thread and add more as I go...

Materials Needed: 

Serial - Make sure the serial/laptop is still under warranty. 

Model/Product number (optional) - Getting info on your product is a plus, but the only thing needed is the serial. 

Steps: 

1. Get serial. (optional) Register the serial. 

2. Call Qosmio (Toshibas) customer support number. 

If I remember correctly the right department for the replacement doesn't work on weekends so call in during a weekday. 

3. When you are transferred to a rep go through all the usual BS (name, phone, email, serial, etc.) until he/she ask you, "What seems to be the issue?" Let the rep know that your computer (that you purchased because you thought was the best?) was starting to overheat, and shut off on its own for the past few weeks.

*You can say it doesn't power on as well, but shutting on and off constantly is good too*

They will go through the standard BS troubleshooting steps, you know what to do. 

Eventually they will tell you the computer needs to come in for repair. Tell them if there's anyway you can receive a replacement first as you are in need of one by next week, because you use it for gaming tournaments or your job. Your job being a gaming related job. That you can do for now with the constant power issues until you get a replacement (if you said it doesn't power on just say you just need one ASAP). You need it for a huge tournemant that can win you $15,000 (or whatever amount) and change your life, etc.. 

*Just that you need one for a gaming reason is enough, no need to go big with an explanation, but it does help*. 

The rep you are speaking to will then transfer you to different department that deals with these types of issues. 

The next rep you get will decide if you get a replacement or not. So now explain to this rep why you need it, etc.. This is where I said it depends on the rep you get as he/she will decide if you get a replacement or not.

4. Get replacement, profit?

Here are some things to note!
 
Some reps will NOT advance anything unless your laptop had prior history of failing. Some reps won't even offer you a mail in for repair. Some will look up the nearest authorized Toshiba repair center and send you there. If that happens just come up with some BS excuse as to why you can't get there. For me, I got lucky, the nearest repair center was about 3 hours away. 

Be creative! Don't call and say "oh my shit doesn't turn on, replace?" because it will just lead to saturation and lower your chances of getting a replacement. 

Have people skills. You will need it if your rep refuses to give you a replacement. As she/he might not replace it unless it has prior history of failure. So that where your people skills can be handy - in convincing them to send you a replacement first. Or you can try getting a serial to a Qosmio laptop that has been refurbished/repaired.

Like I said at the beginning I am just showing you how to get it. You have to find a serial on your own, which is relatively easy. You can find their contact information on Toshiba's website. 

If you have any questions feel free to ask and I will try to answer them asap.
