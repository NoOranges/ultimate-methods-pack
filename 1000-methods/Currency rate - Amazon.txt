Yo Astro,

I pre-ordered something on Amazon UK last month and when I  got charged last week, I saw on my bank account that 5&#8364; more than it should were  charged from my bank account.
I contacted Amazon and told them why I got charged more. They told me that's because of the currency rate. Of course, I told them that the rate doesn't fluctuates so much in less than one month. 
If they don't want to refund you the difference, tell them you want a "goodwill gesture". I don't know why but they are more likely to give you something after saying those words.

I tried them with 42.12&#8364; (~$56.36 USD) with another account I have from Amazon US, and they gave me that "goodwill gesture".

You can check the currency rate here, it helps : http://www.likeforex.com/misc/historical-rates.php?f=GBP&t=EUR&y=2013&m=07&page=
Tell them to do the maths

Hope you can get something from Amadumbs :)
