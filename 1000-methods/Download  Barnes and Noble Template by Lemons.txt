This receipt template was made by me, and intended solely for use at the MagicPID support forums. To request a template, just ask me in this thread.

Please do not re-upload this file. If I find it uploaded on another site, I will imminently take down my version- and require that new uploaded one be taken down also. If you find this re-uploaded on another site, don't flame the person, just alert me of it. Thanks.

Instructions:

1. Make sure you have Merchant Copy Font installed first. It can be found here for free: http://bit.ly/MerchantCopy

2. Open the template and start editing it.

3. To edit it, use the text tool and simply click on the text you want to edit. This template, like all of mine, is fully editable. Every bit of information on it can be changed to your liking.

4. I do not condone illegal activities and do not intend for this template to be used in any special way- other than for education.

PS, I should be releasing a video later today that shows how I make these templates. This Barnes and Noble template is the one I demonstrate on in the video.
