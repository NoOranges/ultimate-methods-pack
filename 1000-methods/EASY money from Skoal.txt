Ok, don't knock me cause this was my first S/E call. So I use Skoal Long Cut tobacco products once in a while. I decided to use them for my first S/E. Their products cost about $7 each. After a 5 min conversation with them they issued me a check for $24. Not a lot, but like I said, my first S/E call.  https://www.skoal.com

Method
1) Call 800-852-8920 (this is there quality assurance #)

2) Hit 1 for English

3) I told the live rep that I really like there products and never had a problem. But was in a different state (I chose one nearby) for a wedding and got a package of 7 of there tins which were about $6.99 each not including tax. 4 of the tins were fine but the 3 tins of Berry Blend Skoal long cut was dried up. I through them all away but still had one of the tins.  

The rep asked if I remember the store and I said no sorry, it was just some small gas station convenient store. She had me read the bar code # and exp date (Jan 15th 2012) on the tin (you could probably just say the bar code was cut off when you were taking off the wrapping). She said with tax the entire amount would probably be $24.25. To add authenticity, I said that I really liked their products and enjoy them, never had a problem. The rep was really nice, said she would issue a check to me immediately and I should receive it in 7 - 10 days. I thanked her and that was that.

So, easy $24. You can try for more, but I wouldn't get too greedy. Also, I used my real info with them considering its a small check and nothing that I'd ever be investigated on.

Give it a try and let me know how it works for you. Comments are appreciated.

Edit - I'm US based, don't know if it will work in other countries. If they sell Skoal products, then probably.
