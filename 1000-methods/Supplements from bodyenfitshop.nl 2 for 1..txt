1: Order a small tub of powder. I did c4 from cellulor.
2:  Open it up a little bit, tear the seal but don't make it come of.
3: Use a small spoon to scoop out some powder.
4: Use a wet qtip to apply some some of the powder to where you spin on the lid. EG: http://puu.sh/57vlb.jpg
5: This will cause it to look moist.
6: Take a few pictures and email b&f that your tub was half almost empty, opened up and moist already.
7: I received a new tub from 1 rep, no questions asked. Friend of mine was required to send the tub back to b&f on their costs. He scooped out 4/5th of the tub and send 1/5th back and received a new tub for free.

winwinwinwin.
