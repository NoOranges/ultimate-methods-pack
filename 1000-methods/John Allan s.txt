Pick out any of there products then go to their contact page:

Tell them the product smelled so bad that you had to throw it out, it burned your skin, etc. Making up something original will bring better results. Now that you told them you through it out already they should ask for a receipt. Generate one with AstroProof or edit your own and they should send you a replacement.
