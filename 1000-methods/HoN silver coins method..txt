Every time a new HoN patch comes out, email the S2 support here http://helpdesk.s2games.com/newticket.php? and tell them that you lost any amount of silver coins(dont be fucking stupid and tell them a insane amount) or 100-300 gold coins. 

They will give you the silver coins right away but they will most likely ask questions about gold coins, just tell them you got one of those vouchers that has a 100 gold coin code on it. Simple as that.
