Hello guys, today I am gonna show you my easy method for double dipping coupons you have received in the mail, for any product. Doesn't have to be food related, I have done this with personal care items etc.

Step 1. Wait a month after doing your SE for coupons and call the company back

Step 2. Simply tell them that you didn't get the coupons in the mail, and you have been growing increasingly frustrated.

Step 3. The rep will have you verify your address, and then almost always will send out the coupons again. You have doubled your SE with a 5 minute phone call.

That is all is takes to double your SE, turn those 4 coke 24 packs into 8, etc.

Enjoy.
