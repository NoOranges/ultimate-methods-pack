Anon's PS Vita method Leaked.


Step 1. Get a serial, WITH EXTENDED WARRANTY.

Step 2. Do as always, not working troubleshoot etc.

Step 3. Say you are going for a gaming tournament and need the PS vita as soon as possible. The Representative will say no but then go ask for his supervisor and boom replacement.

Tested and worked.
