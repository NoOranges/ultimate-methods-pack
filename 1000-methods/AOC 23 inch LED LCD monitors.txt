Ok so Navvin's has already put this but I feel it my right to also post it in VIP as I helped create and perfect the method for a 100% success rate(Ask him if you want). Firstly the number, ring and hold if need be the algo can be anything but its best to put the first X  in the serial as a 0. I came up with the whole lines on the screen idea in which i stated green lines have appeared permanentely on the side/top of the screen and then you say that until "today" it was still working just fine
 but now the monitor has gone completely dead. The time of purchase must be within a month and you can also say that you bought it from a friend at which case NO INVOICE NEEDED. They will schedule an advanced replacement, don't use your real name, if you wanna deny it if it ever comes back to you. Use a fake email obvs and ! MONEY IN THE BANK SON. Now someone please ffs make me VIP <3

P.S The reason i say LED/LCD because they will try to fuck you off if they are out of stock of LED 3D monitors but still #rape/profit/win/bang7gramrocks/winning

PP.S Sometimes invoice is needed just pm and I'll do one for you (First 5 to pm get otherwise fuuuuuuuuuuuuuu)

PPP.S - Make sure you spell out your email with commando talk (alpha,bravo,charlie e.g) otherwise you can't get tracking!

Complain about lines on screen and then the monitor eventually stopped powering on.
