To get serials for handheld electronics just use your grown up voice :)  I've used this for everything from Dell tags, to badass flashdrive serials, to TVs, to phones, you just need to get anyone but a overzealous manager.  

-Call your local electronics store, managers usually aren't there after 6pm, it's the b-squad and that's who you want.  Say you're Alan Lozano (in honor of Apple) from loss management at corporate and you need a Jambox(or Vita, or whatever) serial to track a faulty shipment from the warehouse.  

-Nine times out of ten(or every time once you find the right employee) if you sound assertive enough some 16 year old kid will run and get you a serial, if you want a few serials just sound surprised or puzzled when he reads off the digits and ask him for three more to "verify your suspicions".  

-Enjoy the joys of free shwag without ever leaving the couch :D  My favorite is RadioShack, they hire some gullible people....
