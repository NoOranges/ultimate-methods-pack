Always use eBay.co.uk, this is the worlds largest online marketplace and will have literally any product your looking for this could be anything from a camera to a monitor that you would like.
This same method would also work on a website like craigslist, however an eBay user is more likely to respond.

1. Explain why you need the serial, I tend to say I want to check the authenticity or warranty.

2. Filter the search to "Ending Soonest", this will usual result in a faster response time.

3. Filter the search to "Auction Only", this is because wholesalers on eBay will not usually give you the serial, individual sellers most likely    to be listing via an auction will be more likely to send you the serial.

4. Use the gained serial to SE your product of choice


I have literally not used a serial in a while, I am in the process of engineering two electronical products that need serial numbers, I have had both successive replies from eBay within a hour of asking the questions.

Hope this helps, if you need further advice please send me a private message, I will not provide serial keys for you so dont even ask.
