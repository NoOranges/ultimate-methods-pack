Things your going too need for this method

1)Some type off communication device too phone there support line, http://re-timer.com/support/contact-us/  There contact numbers depending on the country

2)A serial number for there product

3)A good excuse too why the product is faulty, I just said one of the lasers was faulty on the lenses 



Simply Phone them, Tell them the excuse ( I had too phone twice the 1st rep didn't give a shit) Told them Ive only had it for 20 days and I got it as a present ( And that the person who give me the present was out of the country) Women asked for the serial give it too her sent me an Advanced replacement.


Pretty simple easy method hope you all enjoy.
