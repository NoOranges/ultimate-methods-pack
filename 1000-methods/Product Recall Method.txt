Hey guys,
I've used this method for quite some time and had some success with it so I think it's about time I release it to you.

The first thing you want to do is go onto the CPSC product recall site. You can probably guess by now that the method involves submitting false claims. http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/prerelmar12.html?tab=recalls

Just go down the list and look for companies that look like they have easy recalls. This usually means a high volume of products affected and a wide spread of areas sold. Usually with many product recalls, they pose a safety hazard so there you can find your excuse for why you threw it away and can't send it back. The only hard part is if they sometimes ask you for a serial to see where it's affected. Most of the times it's located on the CPSC product page.

Anyways, I found a really easy product to do this to

That leads you over here where you can get a refund of $6 per light. They say you have to return it first so you might have to box. Please don't go overboard though
