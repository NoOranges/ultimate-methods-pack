STEP 1: Go to the site and select your country.

STEP 2: Fill in your information.

STEP 3: Make up a story about your pen being defective and was not working after you unpackaged it.

** Wait about around 1-3 days and they should send you a replacement or free refills. What you get depends on the excuse **

You may have to troubleshoot, if they do ask you to, just say it still doesn't work.
