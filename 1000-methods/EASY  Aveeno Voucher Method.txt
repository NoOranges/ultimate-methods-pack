This is a guide on how to get a voucher for Aveeno. Depending on how much the item costs they will send you a voucher.
All you need to do is email them and provide a barcode of a product.
I choose the Daily Moisturizing Lotion.
PM me for the bar code if you need one.

They will ask for the Lot number
Just put in 209A.
