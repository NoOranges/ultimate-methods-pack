Welcome to my half term giveaway thread. During this half term, I will be releasing methods I found out by myself. These will only be sent to a maximum of five to ten people, depending on the size of the company. There will be no dates and time, so only those who are active will get it. It will be on a first come, first serve basis. I may decline your request if you haven't shared anything (graphics stuff or any methods) within the last month or so. 

If anybody has Kodak printer serials, preferably the Kodak Hero 9.1, I will provide you with all the methods below.
