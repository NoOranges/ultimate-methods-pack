Here's my method for the zune. I personally havent gotten a zune, but the person who gave me the idea has. Dont get pissed at me if it doesnt work for you, it is VERY hard. You might have to do the box method as well. This method is purely for educational purposes and i will NOT be held accountable if you guys get arrested or something. 


Step 1: Get a zune pid, it MUST be in warranty, or you will not get a replacement unless you do a box method.

Step 2: Call them up, and say that your zune stated leaking this gooey liquid and it ruined your phone/camera or something. there gonna ask you for the serial. Tell them that your gonna go look at the zune and that you dont wanna touch it.., it just happened to be on its back and u can make out the serial..

Step 3: they are gonna ask you to send it in. In this case you have 2 options. 
1) Box method (just do the box method and you should get a replacement)
2) Ask for the manager

Step 3:  Your going to speak with the manager now. Make sure you say word like, toxic, harmful. Also say that you did some research and the liquid coming out of the zune was toxic and could make you sick. if the person doesnt budge, speak with the manager of the manager. This is to highest you can go. Now ask the guy for an exception since you could of really gotten hurt.

Step 4: Profit 

DO NOT LEECH

Remember to act concerned for your safety and make up a reason why you ant ship it out if your not doing the box method.  

If your gonnna flame, just gtfo
