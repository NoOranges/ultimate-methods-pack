******************
added another maybe requirement
******************
Well I assumed most people knew about this company and how to SE them, but after seeing that one thread with higher ranking members asking for the method has gotten me to think not everyone knows it. So I'll be sharing it with you nigs. 

I'll post this here, but if you guys all know this simple process I'll post it in one of the lower rank sections. 

This company is very easy to SE. Just a simple my headset it shit, provide pop, receive replacement.  

Items Required:

Serial (50/50) - Not all reps ask for this, but it's a + to have one. 

Receipt/POP (needed) - They will always ask for this, more often than they ask for serials. Try staying away from Amazon invoices, most if not all companies verify those now. Try getting a legit one, or making a good fake one. 

Picture of serial (maybe) - I just try them again and this certain rep wants a picture of the serial which is located behind the MixAmp (A50). So this might be necessary. 

Steps: 

1. E-mail AstroGaming's tech support. Well submit a request support here: https://support.astrogaming.com/new_case 

**************************
I don't think they have a phone number so e-mail is the only way. If you happen to find a working number (I know they have one, which requires you to leave a voicemail but no one ever calls back) please send it my way. I would rape these guys if they had a phone number I could call in, but they only have an e-mail support which takes forever to respond (I submitted 3 request in one week to get one shit respond, whole process took me ages).
**************************

Fill out the request form with the headset you want, your name, email, and message. 

You guys know all the usually BS story for headsets, use them here too such as the headset mic is fuzzy, crackling, no sound, etc..

Make sure to add that you use the headset for tourneys, and you need it as you are going to a major MGL event (not really, think smaller events) and you need one asap. This will add to your chances of getting a replacement first.

2. Wait on respond. 

3. Depending on the rep the reply will vary. You can be asked for receipt so that the replacement process can start, or they will give you some troubleshooting steps, require invoice to start troubleshooting steps. 

If they want pop for replacement, give it, if they provide troubleshooting, it didn't work :D. 

4. Receive replacement in form of advance replacement or cross shipping.
