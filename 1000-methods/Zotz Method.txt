If you have never heard of this candy then shame on you, you have never lived. 
This is quite a simple SE but I put it here because this candy is so damn delicious.

1. Go to http://www.zotzpower.com/flavors.html and click the Contact Us tab.

2. Say something along the lines of my candy smelt awful, my box of candy was only half full, my box of candy tasted awful.

3. They will email you back saying that they have shipped out a new box for you.

NOTE: In your email say BOX of candy because a box includes 194 or 198 I do not remember of the individual candies. You will want this many because you will soon become addicted and if you go without Zotz for too long you will start to itch and have occasional muscle spasms. ;)
