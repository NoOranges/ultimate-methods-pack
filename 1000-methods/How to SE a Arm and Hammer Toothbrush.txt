Hi, I just bought your fucking toothbrush but after 2 days of using it, it fucked up. I am very fucking disappointed of this fucking rechargeable toothfuckingbrush. 

5. Wait for the email saying that they are sorry for your faulty stupid virtual non existing toothbrush and they will send you a replacement coupon.

You can try the other shits they offer. Just be creative.

They are recalling some toothbrush models due too overheating on the docking shit that will cause shitty things . In theory you can get a refund or coupon by telling them that it burn while charging and you just watched the helpless toothbrush burned while you're shitting on the toilet . Be creative with some reasons that will allow you to get a refund.
