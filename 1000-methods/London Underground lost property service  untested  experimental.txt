Hello.

I was watching a documentary about the London Underground yesterday and I learnt that there are many mobile phones and tablets etc as lost property which has been unclaimed.

You may think "This is someone's personal stuff that they may have lost and want to reclaim it" But the irresponsibility lies on them especially when this term from Transport For London applies:


Unclaimed items become the property of TfL and will be either auctioned, donated to charity, recycled or disposed of responsibly. All personal data is removed from property and securely destroyed. Proceeds from auctions and unclaimed 
currency are put towards operational costs of the LPO



Now an item easily lost by drunken passengers on Friday/Saturday nights are iPhone 5's. 
This link is used to make a claim. https://www.tfl.gov.uk/tfl/contact/lostproperty/default.aspx

I would advise using a date within the past month or two months as there will be a larger volume of items lost within that time period. 

Mode of travel is London Underground as it is the busiest network of transport in the UK.

Now basic journey details:

This is central London where most of the popular clubs and bars are located.  
A very popular area at night is Leicester Square which is located on the Northern and Piccadilly Line. 
Now, they ask for your journey plan. You can use the full map of the London Underground which is easily accessible from the internet and find a way to plan a route to either Leicester Square, Covent Garden, Oxford Circus, Tottenham Court Road or Piccadilly Circus.

Now the best start time would depend on the station you decided to travel from; you can use with http://maps.google.co.uk to know how long it takes from Station A to B so you can choose a start time of travel.

Note: The Underground Closes at 1am roughly so put a departure time of 11:45pm-12:45am. (Or you could say the last train)

I would feel comfortable putting my address as they is no evidence that the enquiry isn't genuine as there are going to be many iPhones, tablets etc lost so they cannot single you out for being fraudulent.

This is my experiment, I should try this soon and I believe you should. Comments appreciated.
