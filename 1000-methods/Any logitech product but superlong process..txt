This method is really simple but it takes about 1-3 months. 

Contact them about your broken product and fill out the info they want. I used a photoshopped receipt from a swedish electronic store. They will most likely ask you to send in the product but wait around 20-30 days or so and contact them again and tell them you've been at the hospital because your mother has cancer or some shit like that. Now if they don't give you a replacement wait an additional 35-60 days and tell them she died. Profit.
