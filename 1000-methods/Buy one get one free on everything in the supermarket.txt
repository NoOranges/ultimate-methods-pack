Saw a crappy method earlier so thought I would treat my VIPs to a good method to do this.
The method I read kind of said "Yeah, fill 'er up...walk out...done" now if you are any good at SEing you should never have to worry about being caught as it should be failproof.

Also, I'm not making this PM only as I do it all the time and it's hard to saturate if you do it right.
If you like this then gimme some good feedback or just mention that you think I should be a "Contributor" as I'm giving away such good methods.

Lastly...support your scene...don't give the good stuff to leechers and look after the people who look after you.


Anyways:

-Get a buddy and a car...go to Sainsbo's or wherever...
-Get 2 nice big trollies
-Go round and do your shopping
-Have your buddy follow you round (not too close) and pick up whatever you do and put it in the second trolly
-Effectively you are cloning your trolley
-Go to the checkout with trolly A (get your buddy to go and look at the doughnuts by giving him the "secret signal")
-Pay for trolly A
-When asked if you want to bag it all up say "No, saving the planet and all that" and put everything in your trolley loose
-Grab your receipt and palm that fucker
-Pay and walk out with your head held high for being an eco-warrior
-Throw that shit in the back of your car and close the boot as quick as you can
-Go back to your buddy and relieve him of trolley B
-Walk out
-If stopped simply produce your receipt for all the goods you have purchased.


The only tip is to be mindful of CCTV cameras...I've done this a handful of times and only been asked to produce my receipt twice...both times they have apologised waved me off.



If you like this then please say so... preferably with a Mac Mini Serial and POP ;)

Stay safe homies!
