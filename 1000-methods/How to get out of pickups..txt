I'm sure you have all been faced with a SE thats finished, but oh? They want a courier or an employer of theirs to come pick up the faulty item(s).
Here is a little tip to in most cases, get an adv replacement or just avoid the pickup.

You run your own kindergarden, childcare etc.

Tell them it is against the law for you to allow people who are not direct relatives of children in your care to be on your property when you are legally bound to provide a safe environment.

Ask for a working with children check, simple as that.
Basically every courier/employer will not have this.

Reason why this works so well is that depending on the rep, alot of them will be able to relate to it as they may have children or even children placed in childcare while they working.



Enjoy!
