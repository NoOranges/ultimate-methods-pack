Hello my name is Pinkie Pie and today I will show you how to get free upgrades and free services from your ISP and TV and Phone Providers. As everyone knows a lot of companies that provide these things(Verizon, Bell, Rodgers, comcast) have extreme shit support either over seas, I can help you get past that.

First call up the company and enter the appropriate data. Once you get with an agent say you were talking and got disconnected say you want to talk to CUSTOMER RETENTION(This is the key step these people will go head over heels trying to keep your business and they are usually located in the USA.)

Once you are talking with these people just complain on what ever your issue is.(internet is disconnecting tried all trouble shooting steps. Phone is disconnecting. Internet is slow. TV keeps lagging out and just not working at all, the sky is the limit)

I have personally upgraded my internet to 15-10 and unlimited for $20.00 a month the phone has voicemail and caller display and the tv is free for 2 more months and a DVR for recording movies was included free. LongSimple has gotten an upgrade to his phone early.
Thanks and if you have questions pm me because I can not read anything you say lol
