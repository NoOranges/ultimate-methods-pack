Not gonna spoonfed this to you, basically call up at&t and say you have horrible service and that you HAVE to have it because your grandmother stays with you and she is 85 with alzheimers(not sure how to spell that D: ) and a heart condition, and say that you are extremely poor and are in a 2 year contract with them and you cant afford a home phone on top of that. they should do a workaround, whilst redirecting you to managers and such, and they'll finally say all you have to pay is the tax for it, which is only 7 bucks. took me about 30 minutes to do, make them feel sorry for you and make them feel obligated to help you!

i want this moved to the vip section so it doesnt get saturated.
