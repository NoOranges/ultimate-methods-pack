This process has been very successful for me when trying it with sneakers, but hit or miss with apparel.

Basically, you just shop around on UA's website, and when you find what you want; contact their live chat.

In live chat or VIA phone, tell them that your "desired sneaker" is flawed or broken. I told them that just after a few uses, I tripped and noticed that the sole was coming off from the front of the sneaker. They told me to fill out a form for an exchange, and I asked them if there was any expedited process,  as I can't go without sneakers and that I've only had them a week. She responded with; " Chelsea: Ok, sorry to hear that. I can actually send you a replacement."

Was very easy, within a weeks time they had sent me the new sneakers. I've also done this with their bags, but it's been hit or miss. The sneakers have worked out each and every time though.

Good luck, no VCC needed. Sometimes required to provide receipt.
Make it sound like the product came defective, and you'll surely have success.
