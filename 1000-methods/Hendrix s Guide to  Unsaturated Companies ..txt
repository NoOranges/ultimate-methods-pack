This is more of a quick tip rather than a method, as I'm working on a lot of methods now and whilst I'm preparing to release them I thought I'd share a tip with you guys. With warranty exploitation now a commonly-known term, a lot of fellow social engineers are saturating the more 'popular' companies. I rarely even read the methods section, as any method posted is more-than-likely going to be saturated within a week and you never know when something like the 'iShower' situation will arise again due to an excessive amount of similar emails going out to the same particular company. This is where my method to find unsaturated companies comes into play.

There's many TV shows that speak about the latest technology, it's uses and functions and generally gives their opinion on if consumers should buy the product in question or not. A prime example in the UK is 'The Gadget Show', and the good thing about the gadget show is that they have a huge 227-page list and more of products they've spoken about - and most are unheard of companies. Also, a lot of the companies on here are not UK-exclusive, so US-folk, don't be too worried!

Click this hyperlink to be redirected to the Gadget Show's list, and from there you can pick and choose what you believe you can get. Obviously, you'll run into some mainstream companies that may require a lot more work to be successful with, however, some of them are easy. For example, the first item at the moment is a 'Cookoo Smart Watch' they look pretty neat, they retail for about a hundred quid and there's a lot of things that can go wrong with those tech-savvy watches. Since there relatively new too, they'll be expecting some bugs / problems with their product.

I think that pretty much sums up the 'guide', and I hope it has helped / will help you in the future. Just be creative, be unique, and don't forget to share the methods in a non-saturated area (Contributor & Elite are good choices) once you're done with them!
