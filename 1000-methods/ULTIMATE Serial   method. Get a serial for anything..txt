Sup guise, here is my cereal method lol.

The idea is basically to call a store that sells your wanted product and act like a representative from the manufacturer. I will go into further details.

1. Find the phone # for the store that has your product. Not the actual manufacturer, the store. I.E. a local best buy.
2. Call them up. "Good afternoon, this is Scott with Apple recall division, do you mind transferring me to a customer service manager? Okay great, we have been having an issue with our Macbook Pros recently, and we are looking into what batch of products may be affected, can you read us off the serial numbers of your stock so we can archive it, and if need be we can contact you if these are affected by the recall? Okay, thank you, great."
3. enjoy.

Also, this can work for CD keys if you use it right.
That is all.
