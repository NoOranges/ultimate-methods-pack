Head on over to http://www.fijiwater.com/company/contact-info-corporate-distribution/
You know the reasons  to complain (Tasted like piss,Had metal floating in it, plastic taste. Go read my food guide if you dont get this part)
Submit contact form
Wait a day
They will ask for PRD. Funfact: PRD is the date of manufacturing and plant number for recall uses
They will mail you coupons


Other Info
Know your size - The PRD corresponds to a given size (330ML, 500ML, 1.0L, 1.5L)
Know your limits - The emails are personal and thus if you repeat it it may be hard, you can always go for bulk and say you had a party and the guests all got sick
Do this with any water company.
