Hey guys, I'm not very active on here but will try to be more active from now on. So to start I got this pretty cool tut!

1. Purchase any game from amazon's download store (when I did this I did COD MW3

2. After buying, download the game by activating the serial it gives you via steam.

3. The next day, email/call them saying when you downloaded the game and run it all you get is a black screen or something that causes the game to be unplayable (Be creative)

4. They will email you back or say to try some steps

5. Say they didn't work and ask if there is anything else to try.

6. They will say they made an exception to there return policy, and gave you a refund.

Since you activated via steam, you have the game. So enjoy!

This should work for any game you can activate online. 

Enjoy, please post if you like it and don't leak please or I won't post any more cool tuts!

Here is a link to a screenshot of my refund email
