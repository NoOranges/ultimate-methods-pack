This is pretty much exactly like the Maxboost method, but a different company that is also extremely easy, so I thought I'd post the method for them aswell, why not?.


1. Find a case you want from here.


2. Go to their contact page here and tell them something along the lines of how the case does not charge your phone.


3. They should reply offering you a replacement right away after giving them a receipt and some other basic info. The email should look like this.


4. Give them real information and the model and case color that you want. Send them an Amazon receipt using any generator. They don't verify.


5. They will reply confirming your replacement with an email like this.

Resell it for a nice profit or keep it.
