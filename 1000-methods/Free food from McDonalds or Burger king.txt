Just thought i should bring you guys up to date and tell you whats going on. The apple slices that are distributed to McDonalds and Burger King are on recall because they are causing a disease. 

METHOD:
1. Email or call fast food chain
2. Find a way to complain about the threat that they put you in
3. Profit

I'd appreciate if i get no disrespect for this, it isnt much but ive done it and they said that they are sorry and are going to let me get a free meal. Thank you and no hate please.
