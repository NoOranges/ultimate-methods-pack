Method for Trident Products

Link for support: http://www.tridentcase.com/support/contact-us.aspx

Potential Products that can be gained:
* Phone Cases for most phones
* Other stuff on their site.

Instructions:
1. Contact them with a product excuse saying things broke and etc.
2. They will send you an email, so you must read the email.
3. Look at my attached pictures below for further guidance.

TIP: You have to get the case part by part. In the pics below, the rep told me if the whole case broke or only one of the two parts. Trying to get both parts at once may lead to failure. The easiest way is to get the parts of the case one by one.
