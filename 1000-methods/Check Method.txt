Well, I was just fucking around like usual sending out complaints to company's and ConAgra Foods is one that sends out a check. 

Go to their homepage @ http://www.conagrafoods.com/

Pick a brand then make up a product.

Send them an email with a large complaint/how much you spent on the product.

I did $15 dollars worth and they sent me a $20 check.

Let's see who can get the highest!
