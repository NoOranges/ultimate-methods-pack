1: Follow the link as followed: HERE

2: Enter the subject as "Quality Comment" & Enter you're real information. 

3: Write up your own excuse, I will not be bottle feeding anyone. If you earned VIP then you should know by now.

4: Submit your email, and await a response.

5: They will then respond asking for your item number of the product (See above) & your address.

6: Once they respond they offer to send your replacement.


In Addition:

My first attempt with Mead, when they offered to replace the 24 notebooks...
But once I had received them they only sent 2, so if that also happens to you, you will need to complain again about the incident about how they sent two when it was 24 and they will replace 24 again.
