Ok, this is a simple method the only issue you might have is finding a brand/company. I don't judge what you do with your doll, DON'T POST PICTURES.


What you need:

AstroProof (See Downloads Section)*
Sex Doll Brand (Amazon.com can help)



Steps:


Select your doll. Must be a brand name (Example Untested: HERE)
Contact the company via Email or Phone. (Example Untested: HERE)
Tell themI bought my husband a {INSERT_DOLL_NAME} sex doll for Christmas, When he went to inflate it there was a leak of air. We found that the leak is on the seam of the doll!
They should email back saying something like this:We are sorry for your inconvenience, If you give us you mailing address we can send you a replacement.(*Not Actual Email*)
If asked for POP make one using AstroProof.
Send them your information.
Wait, Then use you new sex doll!



I have tested this method on a company i found on Amazon and it worked, I sent a sex doll to my friends parents home with his name on it. (lol) This will not work for all company's but you should be able to think of a modification to this method to get it to work. If you are lucky they might throw in some free lube! Don't ask me for the company i used, look for yourself.
