They do cross shipping and Bio works for them SO:

For cross-shipping:
Ask for it straight forward and they will set it up for you. Requires serial and vcc.


For BIO:

find your OFFICIAL DISTRUBTOR in your country. Get the label and say post office doesn't accept cause you just got blood on it and you have heppatits B .

Done and it worked for me. Sold my shitty 3DS for 150USD.
