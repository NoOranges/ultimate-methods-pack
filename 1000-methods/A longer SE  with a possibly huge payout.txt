Get together a group of somewhat intelligent, creative, and trustworthy people. (Anywhere from 2-20, depending on who's doing what)

The lot of you will be working on writing a book together. 

Aim for a specific target audience, using a specific type of genre and writing style
Collaborate, and write the book gearing toward that audience.

Create an alias for the "real author"
Sell the book online under the alias.

Promote the book as much as you can.
Wait.
If your book is successful (even mildly so) cash out, and split the earnings.
Profit.

(Optional)
Write a sequel under the same alias, or even a series if its really successful.


When everything's said and done, wait a year or so, and then leak the story of how your successful book was actually just a bunch of teenagers and college kids writing a book together.  And if the book is somehow super popular, anyone who helped write it has the option of going on news shows/talk shows/radio and profit just a bit more.
