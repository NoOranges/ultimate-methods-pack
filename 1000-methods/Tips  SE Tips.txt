I'm back with another thread. So here are some basic tips. Advanced SE'rs should know these, this is more for those just starting out.

1. Always be prepared. Look up the companys RMA policy, see what kind of serials you need. You don't want to ever go in unprepared. 
2. Sound intelligent, and always refer to the ref as Sir or mam. This can go a long way.
3. Never ask for too much. If you already got something, don't try adding on a lot more. That tends to look bad.

Box method:
A lot of people are asking "What is the box method? How do i do it?" Well here you go.

1. You should be shipped a box from the company you want to SE (if box method is needed.)
2. Once you receive the box, go ahead and pack it without the product. Put the label in and etc.
3. Beat the shit out of the box. Do whatever you can to make it seem like the box got fucking destroyed by a mail man.
4. Un tape the box, and tape it up real sloppy.
5. You can now send in the box :)

Thanks for reading
