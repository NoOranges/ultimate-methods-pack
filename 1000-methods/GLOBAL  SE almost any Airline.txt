Chances are this will work with all airlines but it may vary.
For my scenario I used KLM / AirFrance.

When I was on holiday they bodged up my luggage and delayed it. I thought atleast I am getting it back, I am sure I won't get anything for it.

BUT...
I bought some supplies and kept the receipts for the days I didn't have anything and when I got back I e-mailed them about the delayed luggage.

I attached a scan of the receipts and within 2 days I got a call from a guy who said he'll be sending £90 to my ACCOUNT. If you guys need some receipts I can attach them on the following posts ;)


I then this again but this time I didn't attach the receipts, instead I just stated the prices for the items I paid for in the message. Same thing happened! but they said they still needed a receipt, so I said their system was not accepting my attachments(this is normal) and it kept saying it was a virus. They'll accept that and say they'll send you out your money!


NOTE: This does involve you actually getting your luggage DELAYED, if it doesn't you can't do this ( AFAIK).

P.S: I tried this with my DAMAGED luggage, but its a much longer process so I'll let you guys know how that goes :)
