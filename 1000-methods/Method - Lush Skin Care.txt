Lush provide quality skin care products made with organic ingredients. Really good if you have Acne/Sensitive Skin

This is my first method, and i wont tell you what to write but ill make it easy. 

I SE'd them a few times over the last month, and wanted to share this with you guys.

Go to their website. Just google ''Lush'' and look for the product you want. 
When that's done find their support email and give them an excuse about the product, it burns my skin, left me with blotches of green. I don't know be creative. 

They don't ask for POP or Serial number for product or anything. Easy as pie.

Enjoy - Don't abuse or ill take it down :D
