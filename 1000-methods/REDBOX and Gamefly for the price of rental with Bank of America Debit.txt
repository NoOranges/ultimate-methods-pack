You go to a Redbox Kiosk or reserve online, use a debit card like a Bank of America card. I recommend hitting up the Redbox's in your area.

Pick up your games 

Make your gamefly subscription for 2 games 10 day trial with the same debit card. 

Now walk into Bank of America and tell them you lost your card, they will charge you $5 for a temporary card or avoid the $5 by having a replacement mailed to your house.

None of the late fees will be applied because your old card is deactivated and you will keep all the games. I recommend you tell gamefly you didn't recieve the games before your 10 day period is up, they will send 2 more games for free and you won't be able to get charged for those either. If you take too long to contact gamefly you won't get the additional two games because they will try to charge your card after 10 days and they will be declined.

I recommend BOA debit because you can easily get a replacement the same day, I am not experienced with other debit cards like Chase so you might want to call them and ask them about replacements before attempting this but this should work with any debit card.


Vanilla Visa and Greendot don't work with Redbox or Gamefly so don't waste your time!
