Well it's pretty much a similar method to Gamefly although I felt it should be posted here for the UK users as I know there's a few of you.


Quite simple method but will explain it all in detail.


1) Sign up to one of LoveFilm's Free Trials.(You will need a bank card of sorts, unsure if a VCC works or not).


I currently recommend this  http://www.lovefilm.com/partnership/special and use the code AZDM03. This code supposedly expires on the 30th of March but I know you can always find more all the time. This ALSO includes a £20 Amazon Voucher!


2) Once signed up, pick the rental method where you can get as many as 3 games and movies each time.


3) Pick at least 10 games/movies you like and they will start sending them to you. Upon putting 10 choices in they will also send a £20 Amazon Voucher as well!


4) Wait until they send your games/movies. After a few days go into the options on the LoveFilm site and say you did not receive any of your games/movies.


5) Normally what will happen is they will try to send a 2nd batch to you of the other games/films you tried to rent and then you repeat step 4 saying you never received them.


6) Keep repeating this until they eventually cancel your account or choose to stop sending their rentals to you.


7) Eventually you'll receive some letters from Royal Mail asking about them being lost/stolen. Just fill in the forms and send them back. Then you don't need to worry at all.


8) Make sure you cancel your subscription before the end of the month's trial.


9) PROFIT! I got myself a bundle of games and movies for free. Sure there was no case but seriously, it's a simple way to get free games.



Please post your thanks in here and don't be just taking this and running off without saying thankyou or I'll bloody remove it ^-^b
