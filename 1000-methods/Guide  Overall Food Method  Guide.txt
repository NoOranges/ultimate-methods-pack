Hey this thread will consist of the food method and a list for all the companys it can be used for. My hope is that this thread will be the official food thread so if someone wants to post a new food method/company they can post it here and quote me with it and i'll update the list. This is to minimize the method section full of food when there could be just one official thread for it. Thanks for your cooperation
