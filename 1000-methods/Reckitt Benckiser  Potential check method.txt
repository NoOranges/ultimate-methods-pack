Reckitt Benckiser similar to P&G. They make household stuff like lysol, soap, etc. 

1. Pick any item they make.
2. Find a reason as to why you're not happy with it. I did lysol and said the wipes were dry, smelled weird, and gave me a rash.
3. They'll say to contact them. I didn't contact them, and a week later I got $7 worth of coupons for any of their stuff. 

4. Optional: Contact them by phone, keep pushing the SE, see how far you can get. I'm sure this has potential to becoming a new check method. I'm going to call them up tomorrow and see what they say. 

If they end up not giving out checks, I'll move this down to regular, but for now, it'll stay VIP.
