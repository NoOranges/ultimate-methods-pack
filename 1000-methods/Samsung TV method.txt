First of all, you will need a TV serial number that is in Warranty. 

Then Find the model number and get to support page of the Desired TV's Company..
If there is Chat or Phone i would Recommend that but if there isn't email them.

The excuse we are gonna use , Tell them that your Uncle bought you a TV From best buy OR any other electronic store and tell them that when you received the TV the Screen was broken and Liquid was leaking everywhere.

Tell them that you also went to get a refund from Best buy but they told you that the only way to get it was to contact "X name of company"

 Now , they will obviously tell you if he box was damaged or Anything.Tell them it looked good when you first got it

 They should ask your for your information (contact and shipping) Be sure to give them you are Real info and you are Real name. (Use a Drop if you want) .

 Now they will ask you some information on how the TV got to you and was it transported properly. Be sure to tell them it got to you good and that the box was in perfect condition.

 Now After this he should tell you to HOLD and wait

 He will eventually come back and tell you that you will be transferred to someone who is more experienced and will ask you the same questions.

 When you get the Phone Call , They will ask you where you bought it, tell them you bought it at Best Buy and they told you to call Samsung Support.

 They will then tell you to Send a Receipt and Send back the TV .

 Tell them that the TV is Covered of what you think is Biohazard Liquid and then just Generate a Best buy receipt or any electronic receipt with your phone number so you can verify it.

 In the receipt they will call to confirm the Receipt and just put in your phone number and act like a Best Buy Employee.

 After this they just ask you for your info, and get you a Refund or a Replacement!
 

Cheers!
