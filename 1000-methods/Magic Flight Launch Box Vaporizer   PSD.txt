Summary: 
I am not sure if this method has been posted before. I did a quick search and I couldn't find anything. This is a pretty simple SE and isn't very time consuming. All you need is a serial and a picture of the serial. I also created a PSD in which you can use. I would highly changing the image around. 

Step-by-step:



Get the serial of a magic flight and go here and fill out the form. Choose one of the problems given and follow through the problem in the message.
&#8203;You will soon get a email asking for the serial number printed on the back. If you do not have this then you can use my PSD - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO CHANGE THE IMAGE AROUND. They also ask for a picture of the damaged unit but I didn't send this one and I still got the product and some other questions. Just reply back with what the person asked for.
That's pretty much it! The person will respond back saying they are shipping out a new one.
