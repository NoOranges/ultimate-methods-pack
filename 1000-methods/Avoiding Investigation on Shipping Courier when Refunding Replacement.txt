1. Research the products weight
2. Buy something cheap that is similiar to the weight, that the retailer ALSO sells
3. Buy expensive product
4. Complain and say you got cheap product from step 2
5. Get replacement/refund
6. Ship back shitty product from step 2

This works for more expensive items, as they will assume they did a inventory error and it was some error on their part, not on the shipping company, therefore it bypasses any investigation into the courier.
