Classic boxing but I got lazy and talked a rep into telling me I could use a drop box.  NEVER DO THAT!  THEY WON'T REPLACE IT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.  With all my wiles I finally got them to send me a 64gig ipod touch after making one rep start yelling and two poor ladies start crying.  I hate having to use any emotion but humor(it's cheap and mean) but if you guys work it there's a slight silver lining :)

Just saw this is in methods when I meant to put it in discussion, I wouldn't want to suggest being mean to reps is a method.  My bad but if a mod wants to fix it, thanks in advance.
