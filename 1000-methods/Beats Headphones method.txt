Hey, I'm reposting this as squiddy doesn't have time to be apart of a forum and deleted the thread.


What you need:
1. 1 or 2 photos of some headphones (craigslist works for that)
2. A receipt (they don't validate)
3. *optional* i've never been asked for one, but a serial could come in handy.

What to do:
1. Go to beatsbydre.com and go to their support, fill out the form.
2. come up with an excuse as to why your headphones aren't working, i generally say that the problem is with the audio, as that means the photo doesn't need to be shooped.
3. Wait a day or 2 for a reply (i know they're slow as fuck. but it's worth it)
4. They will ask you for a few details about the headphones and for the receipt and pictures so do that.
5. They'll email you back in a few more days saying that they've sent the claim to the warranty claims department and you'll be receiving headphones soon.
6. *only if you're from the US or canada or UK* you will need to box them as well unfortunately.
