New Era Baseball Caps. I haven't really tried to get a free one, I was just fucking around with their support chat people, after insisting to be compensated for a hat that smells funny (didn't give a receipt or anything, just wanted some lols), they offered me a $15 gift card for their website. That comes out to half price on a hat.

Just talk to them via chat, say you bought the hat off Amazon or some place at a mall. Keep insisting that it's New Era's fault because it has a manufacturing defect. The rep will offer a $15 gift card. Enjoy your half price hat.
