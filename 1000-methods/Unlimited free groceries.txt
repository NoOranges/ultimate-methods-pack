This method is shoutout to my homie #UNBANGATSBY2012,

This method is so simple that I don't know why I am posting it but it works as Aux would say "Hella good"

1) Scope out store and grab any items that you would like either in a cart (Optionally you can bring bags in from that store and bag up your things while inside)

2) When finished you can have a get away car ready and just jump in or just cruise out the store with your cart looking coolface.exe as fuck. 

3) I suggest that you do this to stores you scarcely visit. 

This is how DaRkReD Gatsby and I stayed "hella" fueled up
