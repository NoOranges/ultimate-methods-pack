First off , Contact them at their Customer Service (Links Above)
And tell them you bought the Phone Case and it has crack on it when you received it .


They will send you a reply either asking you for your address or provide a Proof of Purchase . For the Proof of Purchase part send them a Amazon Receipt .


They'll send you a replacement after receiving your Receipt .


P.S : If this has been posted i'm sorry for double posting , as i don't see any thread when i use the Search button "mophie" . 


2. This has not been patched just want to get this method up on Monday , so "Mophie" don't actually receive spam mails when they re-open for work .
