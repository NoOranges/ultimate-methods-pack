I recently had the idea to pose as YouTube reviewer, as my friend is a successful YouTuber who is often given many free products for review. I decided to try this out with a lot of products and was successful for many. They will all be posted (separately) in different sections soon, so keep a lookout.

Audio-Technica designs and manufactures a wide range of products, including high-performance microphones, headphones, and noise-cancelling headphones.

Now we're going to take over the identity of another YouTuber, so go ahead and create an email similar to the name of your chosen YouTuber. For example, if the channel name was TekBeatTV; you would create an email something along the lines of TekBeatTV@gmail.com. 

Now, compose an email to them and say something along the lines of this:

Dear , 

http://www.youtube.com/user/channelname

I've been making videos since ' and as a result have accumulated over  total views and  active subscribers. My average traffic each video is  views per week, up to  views a month and this figure is growing rapidly. 

If possible, I'd like to review your '' as I believe my viewers will be interested in this product genre. According to statistics, even if only 1% of the people that watched my review video were interested in the product - this would amount to  sales. If you like, you can also provide me with a discount code for my viewer's to apply at checkout to get themselves a better deal - this makes the offer more 'exclusive' and generates more interest. 

I hope you are interested in working with me and I look forward to your reply. 

Best Regards, 


NOTE: I DO NOT RECOMMEND YOU USE THIS EXAMPLE. THEY WILL RECOGNISE IT RIGHT AWAY.

Within a week, you should have a reply. The reply should say they are interested in working with you and will get a unit dispatched to you right away. For maximum profit, shipping claim the sample and request another!
