Free Guitar Strings!


Very simple, can assume you can all figure it out yourselves also and even put twists on for more.


1) Contact Guitar String Company, tell them you bought a pack of strings to restring you guitar and that it was missing a string in the pack. This was the actual string you really needed also as that was the one that had actually snapped which needed replacing.


2) They should send a brand new pack of strings out. No questions asked other than you postal address.


3) This can be applied to other instruments with similar qualities if need be. Think Violins, Bass strings etc.


4) If they do ever ask for a receipt just knock together a cheap looking one or even say that the music store never gave you one. I know plenty of music and guitar stores that don't bother giving receipts for strings.


5) Put them new strings on and start shredding!






Word of Warning though. Check who supplies the strings. I have noticed that in some countries. A company will distribute numerous brands of strings so do your research!
