Hello, 

Method, Enjoy. 


Free Clothing Method. 


Before continuing to read this does require initial investment and can be done for orders exceeding $500 (have done it before) 


This Guide will also include a list of stores that no not require signature upon delivery (during my attempts) 


First what you will need to do is find a store that doesn't make you sign. 


Some of these include: 


Abercrombie and fitch
Holister (easy I do it for my little sister) 
Nordstrom 
Macy's
The Bay
Armani Exchange
Parassuco 
American Eagle 
Aeropostdale 


I could literally sit here all night naming them. It would be a huge waste of time though 


(Note, Burberry, LV, dolce and gabbana, armani all make you sign. I order from them legitly 
sometimes and they have very strict rules) 


You can either go about this in two ways: 


If you are legally purchasing clothes buy what you want and add an extra 2-3 items 
and pay for them that you want but don't want to pay for. 


When you get your package call in and say you only got part of your order and 
not X items. They will want to reship them, all you need to say is you needed them 
for a special event and will go instore to buy them and you want a refund. Easy as that. 


To get completely free clothing. 


Put in 200-600$ worth of shit into your cart. Pay for it. 


When it comes make sure you don't sign for it. and simply call back saying you never got it. 
You are mad because you own a lot of these clothes and these were for your son before he 
goes on vacation, Uni, bording school whatever. 


Most companies will not even file a shipping claim and just say they will resend the clothes. 


Take the clothes you got into the store for a full refund. and keep the clothes on the way. 


Simple as that! 


Enjoy the clothes :) I know I do
