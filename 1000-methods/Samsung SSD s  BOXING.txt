SSD ONLY. I HAVE GOTTEN REPORTS THAT OTHER DEPARTMENTS DON"T CARE IF YOUR PACKAGE IS LOST

I put this in VIP because only like 3 guys handle missing packages when sent in (in my experience).

Requirements
1. Serial: Easily obtainable from pictures of eBay
2. Phone
3. Box
4. Printer

Method for a Samsung SSD:
1. Call 1-800-SAMSUNG. Go through the automated phone thing to speak to the right department.

2.  Go through troubleshooting and etc. Say there are bad sectors and you have ran secure wipe and chkdisc.

3. They will send a prepaid label through email to send your product in.

4.  Print the label and proceed with normal boxing procedures. IMPORTANT: They get the package inspected by UPS. So you must have the package up to standards (Packaging peanuts and good structured box. Also make the box look slightly tampered). I don't know what would happen if UPS finds the sender liable for the loss since they send you a new one right away.

5. After they receive the empty box, they call your phone number and ask you if you put the item in there. Rage at the guy for treating you like a retard; who forgets to put an item in?

6. They will two day ship your new SSD after calling you.


NOTE:

The SSD's are refurbished. 

I asked for AR but they said, "It is not available for THIS product." Maybe there is a Samsung product that has AR...............
