Pretty easy, Made it up on the spot, worked for me.

1) Call Microsoftâ€™s replacement department directly at: 1 (800)-360-7561
2) Tell whichever agent you get for your case you were sent to this phone number from â€œTechnical Supportâ€? and were told to make a replacement claim.
3) The agent will ask for your case number. All you have to do is act innocent. Be like, â€œWhat? Case number? She never said anything about a case number?â€?
4) The agent will say you were speaking with â€œCustomer Supportâ€? and not â€œTechnical Supportâ€?
5) Act innocent and disappointed. Respond with something like, â€œYou got to be kidding me! The lady opened up saying it was technical support. Ah, damn, all this confusion, whatâ€™s her name? Please donâ€™t tell me I have to call again!â€?
6) The agent will ask for your PID, give them your VALID PID (validate it first!) and will proceed to ask for shipping details!

Have fun!
