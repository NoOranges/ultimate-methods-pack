A simple guide for getting a balisong.

Step 1 - Inquire information
Get a hold of what kind of balisong you are interested in getting. Find out as much information as possible, for example, the construction of the handles, what are the pins made of, are any parts subject to rust, and so on.

Important: Make sure you understand what regulations are active in just your country/state. This will save you *a lot* of explaining.


Step 2 - Contact
Contact chosen company. Be it over phone or mail. Make sure you have a believable story ready.

WRONG: I flipped your knife and it hurt me. Now I want another one.

RIGHT: I flipped your knife and *insert part here* broke and it hurt me, now I can't find *insert part here*. Can I repair this in some way?


Step 3 - *Hopefully* profit

Due to this being the VIP section, I'll let you find the companies yourself to at least prevent *some* of the leeching.
