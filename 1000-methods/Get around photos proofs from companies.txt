This is a simple method, don't know if this has been posted.

Basically, you get any photo you took from your camera, re-name it to file.txt
Then you open it in text editor, and screw around with some code. Insert random letters and stuff.
After you're done, you need to rename it to back to an image file. For example, IMG_3824.
Open the file to test that it doesn't show your original photo, and windows image viewer says the image is corrupt.
Email them back the photo. If they say that it's corrupted, you can now say that you already threw out the product, so you can not take another photo. 
This will NOT work if you need proof for a receipt.
Prefect for people too lazy to Photoshop.
