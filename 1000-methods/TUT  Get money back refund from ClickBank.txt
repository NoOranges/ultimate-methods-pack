Ok in my tutorial I will help you to back money from almost all purchases from clickbank.

Btw.. My english is bad.. but you will understand everything ;).

This is my first tutorial and I want to share you method to get refund from ClickBank.
I am new and want to help community ;)


First we go to some page where is payment throguh clickbank.

Lets say its:

http://www.passwordrecoveryandmanagement.info/?hop=0

Open legit and verifed paypal account is the best for tracking.
Copy all proof of purches. You can print too.

When you all that done. We got item what we want to buy. But we spent money so we want money back :).

Now find contact support of item you buy it.

And send them email:

For software:

Hi, my name is SOMETHING.
I bought your software, but it not works. Maybe is problem in my country: YOUR COUNTRY , I tried on 2 computers.
I tried to run as Administrator too.
Because of this, I would like a full refund of my purchase. Please respond with that refund.
Thank you,

YOUR NAME

For some ebook if you buy:

Similar story:

Hello, my name is SOMETHING.
I bought your ebook, but its not like you describe.
My initial purpose for purchasing this ebook now no longer has any meaning with my purchase.
Because of this, I would like a full refund of my purchase. Please respond with that refund.
Thank you,

YOUR NAME

The next step is the final step, and for most the hardest. We are going to be calling Click Bank, asking for support with our purchase.
	Click Banks numbers are as follows:
•	US and Canada Toll Free: 1-800-390-6035
•	Direct: 1-208-345-4245
•	International: +1 208-345-4245
As these may change, you can find the current phone numbers here: https://www.clickbank.com/orderDetail.htm
We will now call Click Bank, and ask for assistance with our purchase. This is the hardest part of the social engineer, but once it is over, you will feel a ton of relief, and a fatter wallet.
Our ploy when speaking with the Click Bank representative is that the support service of the product was horrible, and when asking for a refund, you where rudely refused.
	Because this is a hard concept to portray, I will give you an example by showing a transcript of a common conversation I’ve had with a Click Bank Representative.

	Rep:

	Me:

	Rep:

	Me:

	Rep:
Alright, could I please get 
	Me:

	Rep:
Alright, please give me one moment.
	Me:

Thank you, I appreciate your help, it just aggravates me that when I spend  I cannot get any help, and they have the nerve to try and say that 
	Rep:
Alright, well, there are two things we can do, we can either contact the seller to see if things can be further worked out, or we can issue you a refund.
	Me: 

I prefer a refund, the support weren’t really out to help me, and seem really money oriented. I’d just like a refund, and to move on and get it over with. So yeah, I prefer a refund.
	Rep:
Alright, I’ll send the refund order, and you should have your money back into your account within 48 h ours.

Good job. You’ve completed your social engineer, and have successfully gotten your money back, whether it was for a legit reason, or not.
