However I noticed I'm going to have to sign.
Is this normal?

The package hasn't officially shipped yet, UPS has only made the label. I used my home address; should I cancel it and back out? Or am I fine?

Wrong thread; if a mod/admin could move this to the VIP SE Discussion Forum in stead that would be appreciated. Thank you!
