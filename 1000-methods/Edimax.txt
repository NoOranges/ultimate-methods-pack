This company is fairly easy to SE. Contact them and tell them what is the problem with your product, they should email you back with trouble shooting steps. You say that it didn't work and should send you a web link to create an rma case. You will be emailed an rma number and this is where you ask if there is any way that they can send first since you need it so urgently. They will say we can cross-ship it and all you have to do is fill out this form and we will send you a replacement first. Go to fakenamegenerator.com to get credit card and put that number in the form etc.. Oh and they usually say that since this is a special occasion they don't usually offer cross shipping. There is only 1 rep working the rma's i think since i got him twice. On the form tick ups ground shipping, that way it's free shipping. Anyways enjoy your awesome new products.

Please don't complain to me if it didn't work, i only tried it twice.
