Keezy619 Guide to SE'ing New Companies

This was made for the little contest of upgrading, but was told release it here on the forums. Originally, has some pointers and advice on SE'ing companies outside of MagidPID

Requirements
Before even starting a company, these are are some of the requirements you need to ensure a sucessful SE.

What you mostly need to social engineer any company is:

-A reasonable story/excuse
ex: The mic doesn't work and ....

-Proof Of Purchase via Receipt Generator/Photoshop ( Sometimes not need )
 BEST BUY RECEIPT
9012 BEST BUY STREET
618-492-0391


-Picture of product ( Sometimes not need )

Where to get them: 
1. Through members on the forums
2. Find picture on Google and Photoshop it.
3. Buy the actual product take a picture and return it.


-Shipping Address/Personal Information/ E-mail (Obviously Required)

-Patience 
 LOTS OF IT OR FAIL 

-Information on product/company (Serial, Company E-mail/Phone number)

How to get serials (Mini-Tutorial):
1.Go to E-bay, Craigslist, etc.
2.Search for your product and pick one that is taken with by a "ACTUAL PERSON"
3.Message them, asking if they could tell you the serial number to verify that its legit.
4.Usually they PM you the serial.


Seems pretty obvious to have most of those to SE, But the ultimate requirement is
Your Manipulate ways. 


Manipulate Ways

Wait, What's Manipulate mean?

Manipulate: To tamper with or falsify for personal gain

Your Manipulate ways must go along the lines of being the one on top and putting the other person in a difficult position, therefore giving in to your ways.

Here's a example of my manipulative e-mail to a company:


Hello,
 
I just got your product and its amazing! but the other day while i was using it during a recording session the mic started to spark alittle so i tried to disconnect it  and i got electrified from the usb and then my computer shut down. i had to go to my local best buy to fix my computer because the mic caused my computer to have a shortage and now i'm paying 79 dollars to repair my computer. but then i tried to use it on my laptop and it start to spark again and generated so much heat that it started to smoke inside of the mic and then i rushed it out of the room into the kitchen where i had to extinguish the fire inside the mic and throw it away. So I'm wondering if there is anyway i could get a replacement.



Of course, the person on the other end of this e-mail will or will not feel sympathy for my story. It really depends on who reads your message.

But if they do feel sympathy, they could respond like this:

Wow! I hope everything is OK.
Please provide your full address so that we can send your replacement today.
 
My Friend Andy will make sure you have the replacement ASAP, and will Provide you with return instructions once your address is provided.
My other friend Brooke will provide you with a prepaid shipping label so that you will not have to pay for shipping when returning the defective unit.
Please let me know if you have any questions.



By this point, you already have what you want. So sincerely reply with a thank you and then you can call it a day. 

 Different ways of Communication 

Three Ways: 
Phone, Live Chat, E-mail.

Phone: If you feel pretty confident and a good bull-shatter, you would usually call by phone. By using the phone to communicate with the company, they can hear your emotions, which helps put you on top and leads them to giving in. Also,Skype will be your best friend with this type of communication, since most companies have a toll-free number to call.

 Live Chat : If you aren't as confident on the phone, Live Chat is your next best option to communicate with the companies. Live chat is personally my favorite option because you get instant responses from the company, but the downside is the fact that if you get a bad rep, the process of ordering a replacement willbe difficult. Usually, live chat will ask for serials, to either send the or faxproof of purchase, and so on.

 E-mail : If you aren't confident at all, E-mail is the best for new social engineer entrepreneurs. In my opinion, I think E-mail's success rate of getting a replacement is higher than both live chat and phone because the more lack of communication, the better. Companies usually get numerous e-mails a day and doesn't have the time to tend to each and everyone. Again, whoever you get as a rep will depend on the time and effort you need to put in to get a replacement.

Exploration

Need a new (insert item here) but the product isn't on MagicPID? Just try it out on your own! It won't hurt to just e-mail the company a story about how your "product broke" . Usually, if you SE a company that isn't mentioned on the forums, the success rate will be higher since the company won't usually have problems like this.
