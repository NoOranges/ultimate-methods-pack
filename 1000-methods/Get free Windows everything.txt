This is probably not really a SE method, but i tought it would be worth a share.
So microsoft has this program called Bizspark www.microsoft.com/bizspark/.
It provides small companies to get a startup without paying for expensive Software.
Now everyone can apply there, just fill in some legit details and after about a week or so you will get accepted and you will have tons of free software! e.g 5 keys for each Windows 8 and Windows 8 Pro!
