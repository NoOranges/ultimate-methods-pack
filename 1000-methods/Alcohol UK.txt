I'm posting this in VIP because I don't want it getting mega saturated in a day..

OK, go in a supermarket, write down batch codes for a case of WKD & a bottle of apple sourz.
If some bitch shop floor worker asks wtf you doing (they won't, it's not too unusual for a customer to write down codes in phone), say you're comparing prices of said product.

Email WKD with complaint, they'll ask batch code, reply.
Email Sourz, same as above (I did apple sourz).
Email Sidekick, they won't ask batch code (in my case), pester them and they ask for delivery address.

So 3 kind of party drinks that you can get for free.
There are other alcohols that can be SE'd but I haven't tried them, still trying to get a bottle of moet from weeks ago.

So if you're throwing a social event, use this method and get all 3 alcohols, else don't saturate!
And most people know these companys are se-able but I thought I'd clarify that you can write down codes in store for those 2 and that sidekick is also se-able without any batch codes atm

Also if you go for lots of alcohol at once, check each brand's privacy/about us page to find out who the parent company is that owns the brand, you don't want to accidentally email the same company twice with a problem about 2 of their products in one week
