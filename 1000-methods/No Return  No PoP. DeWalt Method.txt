So, I have gotten everything i want out of this large company. I will give to the community (Will probably be leaked to everywhere) Its not hard at all. They don't ask for PoP or anything else. DeWalt is a huge world-wide company so i don't think it will be burnt out too fast.

Go to the DeWalt website for where you live. 
Click "Company Info" at the top right of the page.
Click "Customer Service" on the page http://bdk.force.com/FAQ/PKB_SubmitCase?brand=DeWALT&terms=&model=&group=&type=
Make a story. Example:

My name is Mr.SE. I have been a dedicated fan of your tools for years, But i seem to have had a bad experience with your {INSERT_ITEM} 

You will have to think of a passable fault in the product.

Send them the message.


DeWalt is a large company. They will not care about sending you a new item.

I used it to get a Impact drill and a few Lithium 20v battery's

Sorry for the bad visual appeal of this thread, I am lazy.
