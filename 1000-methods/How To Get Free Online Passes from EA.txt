I made this on HF and now I'm sharing it here.



A lot of you may know this as it's been working forever but I always see people asking how to get them for free so I decided to write a TuT really quick.


First, go to https://help.ea.com/connect-with-us


From there, fill out the form with the game that you need, and then pick online services.


When you see this:

Pick 'Live Chat'.


You will have to wait from 5-20 minutes depending on the time of day you are on the site.


When you get into chat with a rep, then tell that your online pass for 'insert game here' says it's invalid. They will probably ask you for the code.


Give them this code:
28QQ-4YPC-JZA5-Q2WX
Optionally, you can switch the last two letters to something else incase a few other people already gave them this code.


Depending on the rep, they should give you a code after that, if not they may ask for a picture. I can help you out with that.


Here's a picture with the code mentioned above in it:

By the end of this tutorial, you should get your online pass.


Thanks for viewing.
