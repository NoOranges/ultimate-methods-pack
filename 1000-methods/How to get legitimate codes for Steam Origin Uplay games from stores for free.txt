Hey there,

This is a method to obtain free STEAM/ORIGIN/UPLAY keys from stores.
It works by taking advantage of store's returns policy.

In order for this to work, your store must sell sealed games.

WHAT IS REQUIRED:

Money to purchase the game (However, you will get this back at the end)

A pin, to damage the disk.

The receipt from your first purchase.

Two branches of a shop, to alternate between.



This method is only confirmed to work in the UK, but if your countries laws on sales are similar it should work the same.

STEP ONE: UNDERSTAND THE SHOPS TERMS ON SALES ON PC GAMES


As I'm from the UK, I'm using the shop 'GAME' as my target.

They have a rule on PC games, where they will not refund you if you have opened up the copy of your game. This way you cannot finish the game/steal the CD Key.

HOWEVER, if the game is obviously faulty, they will exchange your copy for a working copy. This is our loophole.

STEP TWO: PURCHASE YOUR GAME

This is where you need to invest money: 

Purchase a copy of your game of choice, just like you normally would, and leave the shop.

STEP THREE: MAKE A NOTE OF THE CD KEY AND DAMAGE THE DISK

This is the point where you make a note of the CD key the game contains. Now we have to return the game to get your money back. 
Using your pin, add some scratches to your disk. Make sure it is unplayable.

STEP FOUR: RETURN THE OPENED GAME

Return to the store. When you speak to a member of staff, explain that you purchased the game and the disc was already scratched. Show them your receipt, but make sure to not hand it to the member of staff. If you hand it across the counter they will take it from you and bin it, but if you hold it closer to yourself they will acknowledge it and move on. They will then offer you a replacement game in exchange for the broken goods.

STEP FIVE: RETURN THE SEALED GAME

With your newly sealed game, and receipt, enter a secondary store of the same name (you could potentially do it to the same store but you'd be heavily risking getting caught, so be warned). Approach the counter and give an excuse for not wanting the game anymore: My girlfriend just told me she bought me a copy for my birthday
I realized my PC cannot run the game etc etc
If you show them your receipt, plus the sealed game, they will happily give you a cash refund for the game.

At this point you will have completed the SE, congrats.
