Audio Technica makes some great headphones. I got the ANC9s, which sound amazing. They're far better than the Bose QC15s and a little better than the Sennheiser MX-550s. These ANC9s are noise canceling and are extremely comfortable for extended periods of time. They're fairly straightforward, you guys can figure it out, this is VIP after all. Just fake a Best Buy receipt in case they verify. Don't do Amazon. 

Find the headphones you like and go to this page.

Search for them, and look at the warranty for the specific headphones you like. ANC9s have 1 year, some have 2 year, others more. 

Have fun, stay safe.
