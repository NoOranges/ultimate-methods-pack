Nutella is having a huge lawsuit open against them for false advertising, basically anyone who has bought Nutella in the last 4 years is getting a full refund. $4 per jar, up to 5 jars. I have not been able to veify this, because I just found this out 2 days ago, and submissions must be in by July 5th, 1 submission per Household. But I don't think it is 100% becuase they will still have to loose in court first. But I'm sure they will.
