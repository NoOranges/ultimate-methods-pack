So I've been doing this for awhile, and have been accumulating several Dead Island PC codes and several PS3/Xbox360 copies. This is fairly easy.

Requirements:



Receipt
Good excuse


Tutorial:
1) So first you need to develop a decent excuse. What I mentioned was my system could not read the disk or the game is skipping too much.
2) Email this guy:
Jon.Schutts@deepsilver.com
3) He will email you back with troubleshooting tips. Keep replying with the prescribed troubleshooting did not work.
4) He will either ask for receipt or where you got it from. If you reply with a retailer, just say it was a gift and it you have no idea where they purchased it from.
5) Jon will ask for your shipping address and you will get your game w/ 2 day shipping.
