Here is another method :D


Have a CC registered to your account
Go bonkers and wipe the whole shit clean(I bought RE5, the download, and microsoft points)
Now download all the games you bought and you can choose to spend the microsoft points
Now a few days later call up Xbox support saying your stupid little brother wiped your CC clean and you demand a fucking refund. Say you never authorized the purchases and you are mad xbox never verified the purchases
Now they will refund your money and you keep all your shit


Happy refunding
