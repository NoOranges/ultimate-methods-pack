Ok so first of your going to head over to this site : http://www.jumprope.com

They have live chat so say something along the lines of "Got one of you skipping ropes as a present and i started using it straight away and the handle just came off? What a disappointment. Might have to choose a new brand for skipping ropes.. "

The rep will then ask you for your order no, Say you got it as a gift , act really dumb and keep saying things like "Sorry for the lack of info, it was a gift."  and " I have a skipping comp coming up soon and i need a skipping rope"

Then the rep will say "  We do warranty the cord for 90 days so can send you a replacement. '"

This seems to be a small company with a small customer service base, So dont be gready. 

Plenty of new methods coming soon , Will move this down in a couple of days.
