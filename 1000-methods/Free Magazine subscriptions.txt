First off, I assume you could do this with any magazine. I did it with The Hockey News.

contact subscriber services
Call 1-888-361-9768


When you call them, tell them you sent in a check to pay for a subscription 2 months ago and haven't received anything yet. After a bit of back and forth, they should go ahead and ask for your address and activate a subscription for you!
