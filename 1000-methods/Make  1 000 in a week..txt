Well something simple yet effective. This involved eBay, Paypal and your local post office.

Here are the instructions: 

- Create a legit Paypal and eBay account (with your actual information)

- Sell a few cheap things quickly or boost eBay feedback (the more the better) 

- List an expensive product, the amount of $ you would prefer

- Once it's sold obtain the buyers address and information

- Make dry ice, or buy it locally (where I live there are lots of places

- Try and match the weight of the (product) you are shipping by cutting or breaking the ice

- Put the dry ice in a box with some bubble wrap or whatever to make it look authentic as if you shipped the actual item

- Make sure you get insurance on the package (if a package is lost USPS covers the funds)

- Once they receive the package they will open a case on eBay

- You call USPS and give them the case information and tell the story and you will have to go to the post office to show your tracking receipt

- You lose the money the guy sent you via Paypal because you will lose the case on eBay

- USPS will cover you're loss for a stolen item up to $1000, call support and claim your money

- They will send you a check after you provide them with the information they have asked

Maybe if you are lucky and clever you can win the eBay case to, and make double the profit (I have done this)
I recommend only doing this once! Obviously I am not responsible for your losses and or well being. Please keep this method strictly on this forum as I have never posted it on any others. By the way, eBay will always refund the buyer so you are not scamming an individual over time.
