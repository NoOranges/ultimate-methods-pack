Worked perfect for me a few months ago.
Idk if it still does but maybe it does so try it out.

Go on amazon and find whatever the fuck you want
http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=maxcraft
Once you find a product go here:
http://www.mit-tool.com/maxcraft/contact.php


Complain about how you got your tool and it was broken in some way.
They will say sorry I will send you another or they will ask for receipt.
They didn't ask me for a receipt when I did it but idk.

It's a small company and when I tried for my 3rd product, I got the same rep 
who asked about my previous item so I stopped.

If they ask for a receipt fuck it just make a amazon receipt I doubt they know about fake ones, I don't remember if they asked me for one :P
and I guess most of their products are on amazon.

kbai
