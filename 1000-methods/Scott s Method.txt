Hey guys, I'm back with another method. Hopefully this one doesn't get as raped as the 3DS method. 

Steps:

1. Go here: http://www.scotts.com/smg/catalog/productTemplate.jsp?proId=prod10280085&itemId=cat70012

2. Click on chat

3. Tell them that you bought the seed spreader about a month ago and you used it a few times and everything was great but just the other day you were going to use it and once you started pouring in your lawn fertilizer the plastic container holding it cracked. This of course, made you quite angry and upset. You threw away the broken one and bought a new one at your local Lowes/Home Depot.

4. After your story, the agent should offer to send you a check for the price of the spreader (about $52). If they make stupid demands or say they can't do anything then just try again. I've done this method a few times to great success.

Enjoy
