Easy cash to be made if this is done right

1. Call/email a company which deals with mice/keyboards/speaker such as microsoft, logitech, razor, or less saturated companies such as Filco (£100+ keyboards), Coolermaster, Cherry, Fujitsu, Labtec,

2. Tell them that you are the manager of a *insert an establishment that requires a lot of computer accessories* (I'm not going to give you the one that I've used) and your (lets say keyboard) is broken/a key isn't working/ etc, you know the drill by now. Tell them that the whole batch is like that, and it is negatively affecting your business and needs to be sorted out as soon as possible, and you may resort to other brands for bulk in the future because theirs has proven unreliable.

3. Provide them with what they ask for, or make an excuse for why you can't. Examples below:

If they ask for serials, give them the serials. Otherwise, say you're visually impaired and can hardly make them out. This part shouldn't be too much of a problem anyway.

If they ask for you to send them back, you can box, fake ship, say they are partially working, they are unsafe to ship, etc. Just pick an excuse and stick to it

If they ask for a receipt, spoof one or somehow get a legit one (lol). I've used eBay receipts with the hotlink to the seller linking to a closed account and it's worked perfectly.

4. Provide shipping details, get your loot, sell on eBay, or decorate your house even.
