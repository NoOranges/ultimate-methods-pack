They reply fast so keep everything ready.

please reply with any questions if you face any problems lol.

Thank you

Also if you say them like you are 60 years old and you ordered it for your son who is out of town for business for more then 20 days a month and lots of time you cant contact your son just because his battery is dead. i can not return the package because i am not capable of walking and going out.I will send as soon as my son gets time from his busy schedule. 

and booomm !! they wont even ask when will you send it back.
