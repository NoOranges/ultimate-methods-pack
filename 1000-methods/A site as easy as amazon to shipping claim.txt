The site is overstock.com. 

The only problem at least in Canada is they only ship one thing at a time and I have not found a way to group items. 
They have a lot of nice clothes and electronics. Check it out just do the regular shipping claim method and they will just refund you as easily as amazon. With out attcually opening a claim. 

Enjoy!
