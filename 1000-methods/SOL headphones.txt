Hi, I'm sorry if this has already been posted before, but I can CONFIRM this is working.
I do believe this is only for the USA.

Anyway, it's not that hard, probably 4/10.

Call them up, tell them that your wire which connects to the PC became loose and make up some excuse about why you can't return it to them because you threw it out.  I said that I had a child running around the house and didn't want him to get hurt by the wire.

They will then send you an email saying to send a PoP.  REMEMBER TO SAY THAT THE REP YOU HAD ON THE PHONE SAID YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO SEND YOUR 'OLD' ONE IN.

From here, they may send you a replacement wire or a replacement headset.

if they send just the wire, contact them by email saying you were under the impression that you were going to get the whole headset.  They'll just say sorry and send you the whole headset.


Unfortunately, delivery takes about two weeks
