I'm going to teach you how to SE some Blunts or cigarillos! Let's get high up in this bitch.

Head to http://www.swisher.com/web/main/contactus and send them an email saying you went to the corner store and picked up a pack of XXXXXX ( whatever blunt you wanna SE flavors and whatnot) since they're your favorite flavor. This time you were dissapointed because the cigars were cracked and unsmokeable. They should email you back in a week or so asking you to ship the pack back. E-mail them back saying you threw them away since the support took so long to reply. They'll ask for your address and in a few days you'll get a pretty envelope with 6 packs of your favorite swishers. 

Enjoy!
