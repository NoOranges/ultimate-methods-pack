So awhile ago, I found another SE forum. A member there made 4 receipt generators for us. When the forum closed due to hosting problems, I saved these. I got permission from the owner that I post these here.

-Staples Receipt maker:

Use this to make the fonts alike: http://www.fontspace.com/cumberland-fontworks/merchant-copy

(You need photoshop to edit these.)

-The password for all of these receipt generators are: lemonsmadethis

-I'd like to thanks Lemons (http://magicpid.com/forums/member.php?1218-Lemons) for giving me permission to post these here. Do not thank me, thank him.
Also, he told me if you guys have any reciept requests, PM him. (Just don't spam him :p)

-Enjoy.
