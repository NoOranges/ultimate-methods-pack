I take no credit for this I read it awhile ago and works well do anyone who dosn't know already this is great. 

Its extermly simple. Goto store where the sell gift cards/Microsoft point psn points or what ever you fancy   
There's three types 

1.one scratch cards kept behind counter already activated obviously this wont work

2.scratch card not activated this won't work as if you pre scratch it they are NOT allowed to sell it to you and will go get a new card for you. 

3.What you want is  the cards that are not actavated but also don have a scratch part so just the code on the back with a strip or barcode to actavate it. 

Note down code/take picture of the code 
Take card to checkout have them actavate it bag it then prented you left you wallet in you car 
ask them to keep it behind counter , don't come back use the code 


Alternatively some shops don't actavate until you have paid so for example say its microsft points open up the Xbox.com website enter the Code but don't redem it , when they actavate it redem it then go back to the redem page tell them you left your glasses at home if they could use it for you. Hand them your phone the code will fail. Get a second code or a refund. 


Use how you wish be smart and work your own method be safe and don't do the same store multiple times.
