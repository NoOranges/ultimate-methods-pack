Steps:

1) Contact the company http://www.aziocorp.com/en/content/6-support

2) Find the product you want, which in my case a USB Bluetooth Adapter.

3) As usual just say it's not working, keep it clean, simple and short. 

4) Wait for them to email you back saying they will send a replacement to you as soon as possible. No questions asked, no proof of purchase needed.
