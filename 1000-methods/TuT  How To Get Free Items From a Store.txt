Alright this technique can be used at any store that offers return policies on opened items. :cool:

1: Go to a store and find an item with removable internal parts

2: Purchase the item using CASH. If they require any real info you can just fake it.

3: Take it home then take out your preferred item(RAM/CPU) but don't over do it because of the weight factor. Basically don't get greedy and strip out the entire inside :)

4: Give it a day or two and take it back saying it was either broken(make up an issue), or you just didn't want it.

5: Receive full refund and enjoy your new parts :)

Notes: 
- Some stores may require a signature so just make one up or sign in some foreign looking language =P
- Stores like Walmart are the best as the return people usually aren't tech savvy
- If for some reason they take it as far using their security cameras to find you then just say it was your little brother/kid that took out the parts without you knowing and return the products. This should never happen unless you steal thousands worth of products.
- If you are really paranoid then just open the the box very cleanly and take out what you want then close it up as if it was unopened
