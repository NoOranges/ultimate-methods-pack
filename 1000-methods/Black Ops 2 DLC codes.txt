Nothing major, but if you can get a few codes you can sell them on eBay for nice little profit. The Nuketown 2025 sell for $15 easy and the Nuketown Zombies sell for $35+ easy. Oh this can also work for the Drone they were selling. You can sell those on eBay for like $75. 
Requirements 

Receipt - Most likely has to be legit. I used a legit one so I can't comment on fake receipts. 
Steps 

1. Head to Callofduty.com and make an account. You will need one to create a ticket. 

2. Then head to their support section - http://support.activision.com/Contact_Us - From there pick the platform you want, game, and issue. I chose Xbox (main seller) > COD BO 2 > DLC issue > Game did not include DLC code. 

3. It will then redirect you to a new page (after choosing "DLC not in game") which will ask you some information. Such as name, email, store location, when purchased, store number, and for the receipt (upload it). Just get the receipt and upload it. You can also use the receipt to help you fill out the store location, number, date of purchase, etc.. Then just submit your case. 

4. Wait. Usually within 24 hours (that was the case for me). 

5. You should get an email to the email you used when signing up at call of duty or the email you provided when filling out the case containing a new code. 

6. Use code or sell for profit. 

___________________________

Something simple, but can get you a nice little profit. Nothing big, just a few hundred bucks but who doesn't like a few extra hunded's?

As for the receipts you guys know the drill. Ask foos on eBay/CL, etc.. I personally try asking those for the Hardened edition because they have both the Nuketown 2025 and Nuketown Zombies. I've seen both go for as high as $55... that's the cost of the fucking game.

***************
For Nuketown Zombies  you'll have to email their support saying your Hardened edition came with nothing. They will ask for receipt and a pic of the item (the box, game, manuals layed out - pretty easy to find on eBay or Youtube). Once you provide that they will issue you new code(s).

They don't ask for serial. They only ask what the issue is and if they can't fix it they'll issue a replacement.
