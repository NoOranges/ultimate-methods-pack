Hi,

Today im going to share one of my methods i use for eating in restraunts for free, iv been using this method for about 6 months now and eaten out maybe 20 times free.


Requirements: Phone - Email - Notepad and a pen.

Basically what your going to do is email all the restaunts you can using a contact form asking for the managers phone number or email address.

What i use for the best results is get my girlfriend to call pretending to be Trip Advisor or another review website and say something along the lines of your restraunt hasnt had an official review in sometime would you like one free of charge, they usually say yes andsay can you get a table under the name smith for you 7.30pm friday for 2 people.

When you get there you will be treated like royalty and get free everything and express service in exchange for a good review.

Just bring a notepad and a pen and pretend to take notes on everything.

Sorry if this seems a bit poorly explained tell me if anything needs explained a bit better.

i have a few more restraunt methods i use for eating out free i may post soon
