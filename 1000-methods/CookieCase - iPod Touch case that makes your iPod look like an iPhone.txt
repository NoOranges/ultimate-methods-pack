I managed this pretty easily a couple of days ago with just a few emails.
The case is pretty nice, check it out at http://www.cookiecase.com



Email them at cookiecatllc@gmail.com with an excuse about why the case is shit. Be imaginative.
If they ask for an order number, say someone bought it for you as a present.
If they ask for an order number off that person, say they got it from eBay or something.
They should send you a replacement case.
