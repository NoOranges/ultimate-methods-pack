Posted this in Elite about a week ago, but it's some what common knowledge so I thought I'd bring it down to a lower tier. 

Here it is (copy and paste):

This method works for most products that you see on TV that offer a X amount of time free trial period. 

In this case I will be using TryNeat as an example. 

Although the one downside is you do have to invest a tax and shipping fee in some cases. Although compared to the product (this product) you can easily make the money back. 

Required: 

VCC - Needed for the authorization charge. Some might require hold, but most don't. This may need to be loaded with $30 or so depending on the tax and shipping fees. 

Drop - Just incase they decide to bill, but again most don't bill they attempt to charge the VCC. But drop's are always recommended in the SE world. 


Steps:

1. Locate the item you want that offers a free trial period. 
2. Provide VCC. 
3. Receive item. 

Example -

1. Head here http://www.tryneat.com/NeatDesk_10.html
2. For payment plan choose 'Pay in 30 days'. Then choose your OS type. Choose if you want free 'NetCloud'. 
3. Now add it to cart, and proceed to check out. For this item a payment of $31.88 is required (shipping + tax). Which is a save from the retail price of $400. 
4. Enter your detail (Shipping address, names, etc.) and "buy". 
5. Receive the product. Sell or Keep. 

__________________________________________________ _____

This specific item requires a payment for shipping and tax (like I mentioned) but other items don't require shipping or tax (some both) charges. 

And if it makes any difference I usually use Greendot Visa Prepaid cards.
