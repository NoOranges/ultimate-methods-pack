Here is a little tutorial on how to get a $38 check. You can modify it to get more money of your smart (well, not retarded).

1. Go to https://www.thehersheycompany.com/contact-us/contact-us-form.aspx
2. Fill in you real name and stuff.
3. Tell them you bought a 36 pack of Hersheys Candy Bars (would work with other candies too, I'm sure), and come up with a viable excuse to why you were extremely dissatisfied. Ask them if there's 'any way' they can send you a refund. Be sure to tell them that you threw away the packaging prior to sending the e-mail.

Receive your check. If you alter it in some ways I'm sure they will give you a larger check.
