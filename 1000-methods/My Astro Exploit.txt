Ever wanted to SE a headset from Astro with ease?  Wonder why I'm putting this in VIP and not regular?  Cause I know it'll get raped and saturated/patched if I put it there.  I haven't seen this method anywhere on any SEing forum I've visited.  It is not biohazard, nor is it boxing.  It's quite simple, so I'll keep it very short.  
Think of Astro as if they're Amazon.  The method, plain and simple, is the refund method.  You'll need a full investment at first, although you get (almost) all of your money back in the end, other than maybe $10 due to processing/shipping fees, etc.  So, buy the item on Astrogaming.com, say it never arrived or that no headset was in the box but it didn't look tampered with (so the UPS guy doesn't get in trouble), and get your refund in a matter of days later.  I highly suggest you pay via PayPal.  It'll make the refund go by much faster, since Astro refunds faster once you file a dispute.  They're support via email is notoriously slow, so that's just my two points.  I've used it two times thus far, it hasn't failed me either time.  If I see a service up on any forum I visit using this method (I'll know...), this thread will be removed, no questions asked.  This should be for personal gain ONLY, not for monetary gain (unless it's being sold on eBay/CL, I don't really care about that.  Enjoy.
