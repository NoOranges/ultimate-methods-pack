Part 1 : 

Doxing Tutorial: 


1. Find the real victims name this could be found at facebook,myspace,skype 
oovoo or just send a penny to your victim at paypal so you could recieve his 
name 

2. Go to http://www.myiptest.com/staticpages/index.php/how-about-you 
Now then, this tool is pretty easy to use and you just put in the link you want 
them to go to and then just go to the link it tells you go to view the IP, then say 
something like 'This video looks like you' so they will click it and give them the 
link which it says 'Give to them' on the website, you should also use a URL 
shortener for the generated link also, I recommend http://tinyurl.com/ 
3. Now you have all the information you need to do a quick search to receive 
there address, phone number and so on. Here are links encase you are lazy and 
don't want to find them. 

 UK White Pages: http://whitepages.co.uk/ 
US White Pages: http://whitepages.com/ 
CA White Pages: http://whitepages.ca/ 
(there’s different white pages for different countries but these are the only 
ones i know so just Google if ur countries differ) 
4. Once you searched their name and found the CORRECT PERSON you can 
do anything from here some options i did to the past victims is : Prank Call 
make sure u use vpns/Skype go anonymous order 20 pizzas to their address 
again use vpns/Skype go anonymous black mailing (this is a stupid idea i did 
this i almost got caught) 


 Part 2 : 
Stealing Xbox live account(s) 

This person has to be 18+ if u want to find him on white pages unless he/she is 
ur neighbor then u can easily find out his zip state city email which can be 
found on social networking sites etc etc there phone number u may already 
now because u and him text each other if not check social netowrking sites 
1. Save the information you found on your victim in your computer so it can 
easily be viewed 
2. find out the email to the xbox live account (there facebook,myspace,skype 
oovoo or paypal email may be the email they used on there Xbox account) if 
that’s not the case well u could always send them a email acting like your xbox 
administration just make a legit sounding email like xboxevent1m@live ( you 
can choose ur own email/domain) then send them a message over email saying 
"Free 1 month to all gold users expering in this month if you would like to 
renew your membership then visit our event website or you could say reply to 
this email with a windows live ID and Password. ( now ofc u can 
eleberate/design your email to make it look legit but im not going to go over 
that with u) and if that doesnt work than u could always ask hey can i have ur 
email i need to send u a picture of us in middle school its so funny make up an 
excuse good luck :) 
3. finding out phone number this is absolutely needed when calling Xbox and 
trying to recover ur victims account if there a friend and u have their number 
that might be the number associated with there xbox live account if thats not 
the case check facebook,myspace,skype oovoo or paypal etc and social 
networking sets may need a valid phone number so check there profile (or the 
one on white pages may be used but that’s a landline not cell so idk u can try 
it) 
4. when the xbox customer support asks what’s ur security question this 
doesn’t have to be valid anything goes on this part of the database it works ive 
tried it many of times 
5. you should have the city state zip code already if u did part 1 first 
Tips/info: 

(now if this person has a paypal or credit card i dought its going to be possible 


to recover unless u have there last digits if they ask does this profile have any 
credit cards or paypal say "NO" even if it does ) 

(dont sketch out ur fine use skype with a vpn i have one here that runs at a 
good speed and never goes offline just download and click connect) 
http://www.hotspotshield.com 
(make sure u have all this written down before calling you dont want the guy 
to ask u the email and ur like "its umm ummm example@live.com no no its 
this one" that could be a hint of ur under pressure and then the agent may 
hang up or not recover/give u any details) 
(dont ever say "I THINK" thats just suspicous and a stupid idea) 

Hope this guide just helps you
