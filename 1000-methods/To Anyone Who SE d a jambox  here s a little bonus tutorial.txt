If you have a jambox and don't have a device with bluetooth, this is the guide for you!

Just hit up Jawbone.com and go to their live chat.

Tell them your 3.5mm connector cable doesn't work. They will ask you when did you purchase your jambox. I always say 2months ago.
They will ask for your jambox serial number so just give it to them. Then they will just ask you for your shipping address and phone number. After they confirm it, your cable will be on its way.  Enjoy using your jambox with non-bluetooth devices! This might work for charging cables or ac adapters too. I didn't have to send a PoP or anything just a valid jambox serial.
