Hey guys just a very quick but very useful tip when trying to get a kindle serial number

1. message aload of sellers on ebay for there serial number

2. they will reply "here is the serial number - XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX- however it is currently registered on amazon)

3. keep note of the serial number, and wait for the listing to end

4.next day after the listing ends, the previous owner will hopefully deregister the kindle before sending it to the new owner

5. REGISTER THE KINDLE - BEFORE IT GETS TO THE NEW OWNER. so register it within 24 hours of the bid ending, and keep trying till it lets you

this worked for me , obviously it changes from person to person but try it and let me know your results

TO ALL THE PEOPLE SAYING FIND A NEW ONE- most people will not give out there new kindle serial for this very reason

:D
