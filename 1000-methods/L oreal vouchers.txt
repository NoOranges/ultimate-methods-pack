This is going in VIP because it will actually saturate, even though it's big, if placed in normal method section.
I know this method is common sense but because it's a skincare product, allergies happen and can happen at any time during use of the product.

I chose a £8 product and complained about it, they're sending at least £8 in vouchers.
Just pick your product, email them, tell them you had a reaction, make it sound good and receive vouchers.

Vouchers are LQ but £8 of skincare isn't bad for minimal effort.

Well now that I'm actually VIP, I'll edit this post and show you guys what I got. I got sent £10 in vouchers. It's not fantastic, but it's okay for free and will get me another 2-3 man products.
