i think you can just do this but who the hell knows >.< some others should try the serials out as im not familiar with philips and how they do their pids. Anyone wanna tell me how ill get the algorithm or give me more wokring ones. Can be added to the program.

I just told them it wasnt charging properly but ive used other chargers and that didnt charge it but it would charge my bros. They will only send the base but you can easily se a charger and some heads :D

Good luck guys!
