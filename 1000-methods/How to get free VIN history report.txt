Requirements:
eBay account
VIN(Vehicle Identification Number)


This can be very helpful for anyone who wants a new car so they can be sure they are making a good investment. This may not be helpful for members under 16, but you save $30-50. 

Steps:
1)Go to http://motors.eBay.com
2)Click "Sell" and enter your cars VIN
3)Fill everything else out and make the price HIGH so no one buys it especially if you don't have it.
4)Go back in the listing and click "Free History Report" and then click "Full History Report"
5)Make sure you end the listing(Even though it's ended, you can still go back and look at the report or add a new VIN to check)

It's real easy and quick and helpful if you need a vin report but don't feel like spending money. Also the report is from Experian which is like CarFax and is trusted. :)
