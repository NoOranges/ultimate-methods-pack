Nero's GoPro Guide
Hello, Today I'm going to teach all of you guys how to get a GoPro.
Requirements: Serial, 2 testicles, fake/legit PoP (depends).




Boxing method
1. Contact them here http://gopro.com/support?search-knowledgebase

2. Describe to them how it will not turn on and they will go through troubleshoot in a couple emails.

3. After they can't get your camera to work, they will ask for receipt and serial to set up RMA.

3A. At this point you can either go search on eBay and get one, which shouldn't be hard or make a legit looking fake one (avoid amazon). They usually verify but you can get lucky in a couple go's.

4. If you pass this part congratulations. Now they will send you a FedEx prepaid label. Box as usual, add dry ice for extra precaution although not needed.

5. The rest is pretty self explanatory just act oblivious and they will investigate. In a week you should receive a new Go-Pro.

Advanced Replacement
1. Ok, This takes real social engineering. First get through the troubleshoot.

2. Describe why you can't send it in first (make your own excuse).

3. They might bicker back and fourth a bit but just call and speak to a supervisor, should get you AR.

4. They will approve ADV. RMA and then just send the empty box with the label they provide.

5. Done now to avoid bullshit from them, coperate with their emails and have fun.
PRO TIP
You can fit multiple cameras in one box with one label ;)
