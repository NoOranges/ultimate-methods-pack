Ok, so I was bored and I figure my gf can use this shit so here goes. This was all thru email and no POP required.

1) Go to neutrogena's contact us page @ https://www.neutrogena.com/ancillary/contactus.do

2) Next fill in required info, under the select a topic drop down menu  choose "Product complaints and issues". Then insert sob storyhttp://se-king.net/images/smilies/biggrin.gif for product you want and send it!

3) Maybe two days later you'll get one or two of these http://i.imgur.com/kjyrg.png

4) At this point you can call or in my case I really didn't feel like doing that so I made up an excuse.

5) Then I got this http://i.imgur.com/3IWWx.png once again Google is your friend for info needed. Btw I didn't go crazy for "dollar amount paid for product"

6) Another two days or so and I got this http://i.imgur.com/WPEuY.png
Ok so "Compensation" is actually...in my case a $20 coupon/gift voucher  for any neutrogena product (the voucher value im thinking was based on  me telling them I bought only 2 bottles of****). Finally it only took  about 3 days to receive compensation.

7) Anyway once again this {TUT} was brought to you by me. Thank you and come againhttp://se-king.net/images/smilies/biggrin.gif
