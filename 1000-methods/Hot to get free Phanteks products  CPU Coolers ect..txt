Hot to get free Phanteks products.



You will need:

-Serial number
-Amazon receipt (Use AstroProof) 


1. Find a product you like then contact them via live chat or email.
2. Tell them you have some problem with the product.
3. Go though the troubleshooting process, say nothing works. 
4. They will ask for a S/N and receipt (use an amazon one).
5. If all goes well you should get your replacement. (: 
 
Note: The review method also works with this company, they sent me a Primo case and a PH-TC14PC Cooler.
