Here we goo..

Head on over to http://www.urbanears.com/, and pick out one of there headphones..

Contact them at support@urbanears.com, just make up something realistic.. (buzzing,no sound, etc)

Wait for an email back, they will ask for PoP..

Then they should ask for your address to send the replacement.

That is how it went for me.
