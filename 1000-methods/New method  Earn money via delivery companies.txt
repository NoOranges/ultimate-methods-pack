Hey guys, I feel this is a good method and is worthy of contributing to Astro! Now, this will take time but you can come out with a big payout if you are a good SE and also depending on how much money you go for.

Basically, I decided to a pretty big SE for my first SE ever and tried to get myself £500, when I first started SE'ing, I was much more creative than I am now haha.

But anyways, you need a delivery company to target. I used royal mail for my SE personally because i'm from the UK but i'm sure others will work. Basically, I sent an envelope off to an address on the back of a scratch card pretending I had won £500 on a scratch card.

I then proceeded to tell royal mail that I emailed the company who I sent the scratch card off to and they said that it never arrived so what you are doing is basically shipping claiming royal mail but without actually buying anything. Obviously this would work with a higher amount but it depends on how good you are of an SE'er and it also depends company also.

I did this as my first SE as I said and pulled it off and got myself £500 which was pretty nifty, it took less than 3 weeks which might seem like a long time but its worth it in the end! :)
