Tell them that you received a pair of shoes as a gift and even though the person who bought them for you ordered the correct size they do not fit, the sole of the shoe fell apart after minimal use, a staple in the shoe cut you, etc.

They should ask you for your address to send gift cards for the amount the shoes are worth.
