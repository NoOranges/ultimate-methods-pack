Everything is Automated, so just go there and pick which one you had, where you bought it (I chose amazon), and how many you got.

Then pick which ones you want as a replacement and fill out name/address.

Press submit, and allow up to 2 weeks for delivery. You WILL NOT get a call, or even an e-mail saying anything. I wasn't even sure if it worked. But the UPS guy just dropped my package off with 2 of them.


I just called their technical support and told them I  threw the old switch out and a representative just said "Oh thats fine  if you don't have the old switch just ignore the envelope."
