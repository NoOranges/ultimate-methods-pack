First of all HP monitors are one of the easiest things I have SE'd in a long time. 

Requirements:
- Drop because they will bill you
- Serial + Product Number of the monitor you want 23" or less!
- $1 minimum Visa VCC (Must be Visa - I have tried both Amex + Mastercard VCC's they don't work!)
- Receipt Not Needed!

Process:
1. Call HP Customer Support
2. Once connected to an agent tell them that the monitor isn't working, it was working fine yesterday and now all of a sudden it doesn't turn on anymore. Tell them the light on the power cable is on and working.
3. Just go along with troubleshooting and eventually this agent will tell you it needs to be replaced.
4. The rep will have to transfer you to a hardware supervisor as only they can process replacements.
5. The rep will ask you for a VCC as collateral so give it to them. They will offer faster shipping at your expense say no ground will be fine unless u can't wait in which case have more then a $1 VCC.
6. They will give you an order number which I suggest you save.
7. Get the monitor.
8. Give MasterKush some Kush!
9. Rinse and repeat you should at least get yourself 6 monitors!

Notes:
- Don't do more then 1 at a time they will cancel your order trust me I know first hand.
- They don't send you a power cable so you can SE one easily only after receiving your monitor, don't wanna risk ruining all that hard work!
- Literally this is such an easy SE however your gonna be talking to people who are very hard to understand!
