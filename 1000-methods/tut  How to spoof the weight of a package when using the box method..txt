Ok this is my first tutorial here on AstroPID I hope you like it. If you have any questions please feel free to ask me. I can confirm that I have used this method in the UK and it worked.

Ok so many of you will most likely know that in the UK when using the box method to SE companies like apple the box you are sending must weigh roughly the same as the product you are supposed to be sending. Using this method your box can be the same weight as the product when you ship it but empty when it is received by the company.

Fill your box with Ice! Obviously not the entire box but place ice of roughly the same weight as the product inside your box (somewhere water will leak from and not get trapped).

Whilst the box is in transit the ice will melt leaving your box empty. 

This method is really simple and easy to do PLUS it will help to make your box look damaged since the cardboard will become warped like it has been tampered with.

another method that will work just as well but wont damage the box with water is using carbon dioxide. If you have access to a carbon dioxide fire extinguisher spray some CO2 into a mould and it will solidify. place the block in your package and send. as the package is in transit the carbon dioxide will evaporate away leaving the box empty.
NOTE: the co2 will begin evaporating immediately so make sure you spray enough for it to still be an appropriate weight by the time you reach the post office
