Hey guys, I've been doing this for a while now, I just saw a question about redbox and decided to post this xD

Anywho, in order to do this you MUST have a paypal debit card only funded by your paypal. (Request one, it's not hard at all to get accepted)

Put the initial value of what you will be checking out in your paypal balance to be used by your card. ($4 in my case as I rented two games)

Go rent dem bitches, you will only be charged the initial renting fee.

Go back to paypal and cancel your card, if you can't seem to do this just report it as lost.

Request a new card, rinse and repeat.

I've done this twice now with my personal account and nothing has came up.





I realize it's kinda circumstantial but fuck it's free shit,
