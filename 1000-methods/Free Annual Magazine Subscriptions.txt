This is my simple guide to getting magazine subscriptions annually for free.

The thread here reminded me of my method of this.

A lot of magazine companies have little fliers in the magazine for a new subscription. You need to find one of these but you will also have to have the kind that says "Bill me later!". The bill me later option is not very common but it is in some high priced magazines. Take 'Make Magazine' for example, it is a $15 magazine and they have the bill me later option. Simply just fill out the subscription leaflet and enjoy your year of magazines. At the end of the year they will send you a $30 bill, here you have two options.

Option 1:
Ignore it and pretend you never got the bill, they will send more bills then but will never actually do anything except send mail.

Option 2:
Call them up and tell them that you received a bill for 'Make Magazine'. Then tell them that you had never subscribed to this magazine and that you never received any issues of it. They will apologize for the inconvenience and never bother you again.

This is my first guide I have ever posted on AstroPID, try it and tell me what you think.
