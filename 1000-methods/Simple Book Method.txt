How to get free books:




1) Go on Amazon.com and find a book you want. Take note of the publisher and the ISBN number.


2) Find the publisher's contact us info and send them an email. Include a simple excuse like the last few pages had ink smeared or a few pages were missing (I suually use the ink smearing).


3) They usually ask for your address to send the replacement to and for you to discard of the original in an environmentally friendly manner.




That's really all there is to it. There are lots of publishers out there, so use that to your advantage. I've got many books this way, including expensive textbooks I've needed for school (although they often take a while to ship, so do it well in advance)
