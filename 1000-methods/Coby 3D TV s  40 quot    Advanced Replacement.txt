This will only work for TV's 40 inches and above.


1. Obtain a serial from usual sources, I recommend the usual suspects ebay etc.

2. Call up Coby Technical support - 800-727-3592 -

3. Tell them your excuse for why your TV is not working, wont turn on etc...

4. Troubleshoot, then when its discovered its faulty they will ask for inhome service, where they send a technician out to repair it,

5. Use standard excuse(or be creative if this gets saturated) for example your working irregular hours so wont be home - don't all call up saying your in army and etc etc THIS WILL GET SATURATED

6. Provide VCC, (and possibel receipt was not requried for me)

7. Enjoy the replacement TV - don't send your old one back ;)
