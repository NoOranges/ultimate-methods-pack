1. Call up Epson about your projector.
2. Tell them your projector isn't working anymore and you would like to use the Epson Road Service Program. http://www.epson.com/alf_upload/pdfs/flyer_epson-road-service-program.pdf
3. Don't send the old projector back.
4. Profit?

Note: I couldn't try this out since I'm not located in the USA/Canada. But I don't see why it wont work. Like it says on the link I posted they provide you a new projector with overnight shipping and expect you to send the old one. Dont know if they bill so try it at your drop first.

Note2: I cant look at the replies of this thread because I cant access VIP so don't go apeshit like you guys did on my surface method.
