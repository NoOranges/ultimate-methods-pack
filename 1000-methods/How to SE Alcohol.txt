Works well with spirits! 


Hey guys, 

Just wondering if you have changed anything in the Vodka in the last month or so. 

I bought a bottle of my favourite Finladia from ******* and it was just CRAP!
 It tasted so watered down we were mixing half and half. Could hardly taste it. 
Now shamefully I know what it should taste like (check my bank statement lol) and I'm a big fan.
 But this bottle was just not good! 

We took it back to *******  and they said to contact you guys as there is nothing they can do once opened :( 

Help!


They will reply with somethin like.


 
I am writing to you with respect to the problem you have encountered with ####### you recently purchased. 
 
I would like to thank you for taking the time to let us know of the problem. We take our customers&#8217; satisfaction very seriously and appreciate the effort you have taken to give us feedback.
 
Could I trouble you for some more information? Could I get your address and contact telephone so I can arrange to send you replacement stock. Also we would like to investigate this further so I would like to find out if you still have the bottle if I could have your contact number that would be greatly appreciated. 
 
Thanks ### and I look forward to hearing from you!


Has worked with the only 2 companies I've tried :) Some ask for the lot number on the bottle but you just goto a grog shop and take a pic :)
