  Quick way of getting gift card

  
Buy a pair of shoes and ask for a gift receipt 

  
Take home and put some chewing gum on the bottom of the shoe, walk in them a little basically work the sole out a little.

  
Go back to the store and kick up a massive fuss how you were sold a used item blahhh blahhhh blahhhhh

  They will offer you a refund, not good enough!!!!!!!!!!! 

  you bought the gift for a friend/ or girl friend or some nigga you got a crush on.

  Emphasise how much of a dick you looked like when they opened it and it was used.

  
At this point she will get the manager explain the same story the manger will offer you a £5 gift card on top of a refund/exchange. stick to your guns they will go up slowly tell them you spent more on travel getting to the store because of their cockup, she will understand and offer £10 now.

  tell her that's not good enough and you want her name and all the information needed to report the store to  higher up or whatever they will cave instantly and offer you £20 gift card plus your refund.
   
  I usually stop there but for you more experienced engineers they can offer up to  £50
