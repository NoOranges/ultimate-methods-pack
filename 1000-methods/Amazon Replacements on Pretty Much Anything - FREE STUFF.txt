Here's how to get a replacement on pretty much any item on Amazon. Note, this might work with regular ground shipping, but I've only tested this with 1 day shipping. It also only works if you live in the East Coast. Be sure to wait at least a couple hours after buying something to do this. It will NOT work if you do it immediately after buying.

1. Buy something from Amazon with 1 day shipping.
2. Check your order to make sure they're shipping with Lasership. If not, cancel the order and start again from step 1. 
3. The night before you get your item, go on Amazon and check the tracking. Lasership is very slow to give tracking updates, chances are you'll have no tracking info other than "shipment departed warehouse". If not, cancel the order and start again from step 1.
4. Start a chat and ask the rep where your item is. Tell them that its supposed to get there in less than 24 hours and there's no tracking info. They'll tell you that it got lost between the warehouse and shipping facility. They will then offer you a replacement. Accept it.
5. You'll end up getting the original item on the expected delivery date and the replacement one or two days later. 
6. Ask for a refund.
7. Send back one of the items.
8. Enjoy your free item.

Pardon my inactivity, I've been busy with life. Hopefully this makes up for it a little and helps you guys out.
