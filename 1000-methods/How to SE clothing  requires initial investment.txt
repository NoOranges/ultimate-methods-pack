I will share with you how I have managed to SE a couple of shirts and sweaters. 

1) Find a online shop with a shirt you like a buy it. Try and make sure it's not a huge online shop like Karmaloop. This will only work if you don't sign for the package so really look for a ghetto ass website.
2) Receive the shirt at home and whatnot then wait a week or two and ask them what is going on with your order. They will tell you it's shipped just tell them it never arrived and usually they will re-ship the same shirt if you make them believe you. 
3) You have two choices now you can either Email them asking them to change the shirt to a different one that costs the same amount (Tell them they didn't have your size in that shirt when you ordered) and they will switch the order if you got to them on time. If it's too late just return your new shirt and tell them it doesn't fit and grab your refund. 

This method will work on most small online clothing shops and I hope you put it to good use.
