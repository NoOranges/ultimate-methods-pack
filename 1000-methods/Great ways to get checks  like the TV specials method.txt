One great way I found to get checks is by getting checks :P

Well I mean an easy way to get checks or know if a company give out checks is simple. All it takes is finding a company that offer your 'Money back guaranteed' type of products. 

So that's it really. Just look for any product/company that offers your money back and SE them into a check. This can get you a few hundred in an hour or so, which is not too bad. 

The checks can vary from something as small as $20 - $200+. Even if one single product cost $20 you can pull off an even bigger check by SE-ing them and telling them you bought in bulk but after being dissatisfied with your first two products you don't see yourself using the others. 

The only requirement you most likely will need with most companies, especially if claiming you bought in bulk, is a PoP. We some l33t niqqas; A receipt should be easy to get. 

So now let me format this thread in my old traditional way. 

Requirements: 

Receipt (sometimes) - For proof of purchase 

Steps: 

1. Go to Google.com or your favorite search engine. 

2. Search 'Moneyback guarantee products' 

3. Now go through all the companies/products that come up and work your magic.

4. Provide receipt. 

5. Receive check.

You will come up with a shit ton of sites that will give you your money back. And all those small checks eventually add up. 

Here are some few companies that do this - Acuvue, Swiffer, Secret, Pantene...

Some companies will want you to return in to the purchase store if contacting them directly about a refund, so sometimes the best choice is to go with 'help/troubleshoot' option first, and then going about a refund from there.

After writing this up I realized it may be like the simple get a coupon method from companies, but eh whatev. This trick just helps you find the companies that give you your cash back instead of a coupon.
