Haven't post recently, and I'm posting in regards of Novum so:

1. Go to http://nomadzgear.com/renegade-h10 (I did these headphones)

2. Or directly on customerservice@frogeye.com

3. Give some excuse (don't use "they don't work" excuse)

4. They will ask for serial of headphones, but again they are dumb enough so they didn't hide serial on picture of headphones 

Example is H101012000052

5. They didn't ask me for receipt, but if they ask, astroproof will work probably, since they are selling them on Amazon as well.

6. They will also ask you to ship your faulty first, so just SE your way to AR, until you get email like this:
