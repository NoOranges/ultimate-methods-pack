Read it and weap.

Get a serial #.
Call Complain, Provide receipt from the last 30 days, a fake one should do, tell them that you'd like it replaced, go ahead and give them your vcc.. If they say that you need to return it to the store say that they are all out and can not replace it. 
They'll take down your info, go ahead and you know give it to them.

Bam replacement tv. Have fun. ^_^
Don't ask for serial #'s please. Or anything else like pictures. lol
