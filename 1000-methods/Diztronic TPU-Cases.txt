Hello everyone,

I have some new vulnerable companies to share to you, I'll share them on the Contributor section and Elite. Maybe in the VIP section too.

Today, I'm sharing a new vulnerable phone cases company: Diztronic.
They have a lot of phone compatibility, but not a lot of cases for each one.

1- Go to tpu-cases.com.
2- Select the one you want.
3- Contact them with an excuse.

4-
    a. I think there's only one rep: Stephanie. Don't try bulk or this company will be dead in a few weeks.
    b. She will ask to you a proof (picture) but not necessary; I just said, to be pleasant and respectful, I wasn't home so I couldn't give her any proof. On the same email she asked to me to give her the order ID from Amazon. I said I didn't know what it was and I gave her a photoshoped Amazon receipt. She said:
Thanks for the screenshot.  I'm not sure why but I haven't been able to locate you order.  However, obviously I can see that you did place an order with us in September.  If your shipping address hasn't changed from the one on the order details page then I can go ahead and ship a replacement to that address today.

5- Done.

It's a small company (that's why I post it on the Contributor section) but their case are very good, and not very expensive too.

Enjoy!
