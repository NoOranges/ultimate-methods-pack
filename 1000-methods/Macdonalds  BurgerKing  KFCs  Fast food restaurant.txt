You will need: 


A brain
Money
Fake strands of hair / pluck from friends???  *Optional
Drama

1. Buy with your own money a set lunch
2. Sit down and consume half of everything in the set lunch
3. Put the strand of hair prepared earlier into the burger? Fries? Coke?     OR *If you dont have a strand of hair //
    Suddenly yell in the midst of eating and make sure ppl notice you, then , immediately discard the set lunch you ordered into the    rubbish bin.
4. Walk angrily back to the sales assistant
5. They will sort it out and either do a refund (Got to say that you will not be eating in *desired restaurant because of this incident,health conscious and afraid the same thing happening again) , or a replacement set.

Still not happy with it? Ask for manager, let them do what they deem fit, either way, you reap the benefits!

Good luck!

Enjoy~
