Woah, guys. Not too fast!

Don't saturate companies by thinking too fast! Think again and wait!




Introduction
Equiso is a company who makes low-powered streaming smart sticks running Android. The company has been criticised for potentially rebranding low-spec Chinese Android TV Sticks. Due to their lack of transparency and often faulty products, this gives them vulnerability to a social engineering attack. That's where we come in.

Method

Initiate contact with Equiso - http://support.equiso.com/anonymous_requests/new
Complain about their product.
Go through a (possibly extensive) communication process via email.
Receive your product.
Factory reset it and erase everything if the box is open; they may open the box for testing the replacement before sending it to you I don't trust them when they say that.


Evaluation
Simple method. Mediocre TV sticks, but stick an SD in and you can download movies for your TV while the TV's off using BitTorrent (it uses an external power adapter).
