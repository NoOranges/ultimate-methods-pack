Call, Complain, You know the norm. 
Dead Pixels and what not, lines screen won't work, just some generic bullshit reason.
They'll say it needs to be replaced, if they don't offer AR say you need your monitor for work, and that you're a photographer so you need to have it to shop pictures, or you're a digital artist, or you use you know, never mind, usual bullshit excuses. ^_^
They'll agree to AR.
They shouldn't put a full hold on vcc. (didn't for me, No bills yet)

Have fun with your monitor; 
Don't ask for a serial, go find one yourself, And watch this method get sold too.
