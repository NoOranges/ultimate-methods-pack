Alright, So here's my personal favorite method for obtaining serials, if AstroPID Generators don't have it.

First go ahead, and hop onto ebay, (No this isn't asking them for the serial) then go down the listings, and right click and open in new tab for all of them. Go down and through the listings, and view the pictures, eventually if you look hard enough, you'll be able to make out the serial of the device provided. 
Here's an example of what I am saying. People like to post proof that it's their device, so let's take their device, and their warranty onto our device. :)

That's just an example, I've also got an Iphone 5 From this method.

Good Luck. :)
