Poor Pebble, anyways.

You're gonna get a pebble fucking watch from this. And I use this about every day, which is the only reason did this SE almost a year ago. Anyways...
http://getpebble.com/

That's the website if you don't know what A pebble watch is.

Requirements;
Serial#
Time to fucking wait
Picture of the Serial# on the device
Picture of the Flaw (if it's a screen issue)

Time Frame; 1-3 months.
I'll be honest the first time I did this SE, it took less than 3 days, for it to ship and be over nighted to me.
The Second time, I actually needed my fucking watch fixed, did the SE in March, No reply after giving them my serial# and filling out the request form until after school ended in june. :P Anyways it should still work if you can get everything;
They'll either ask you to cross ship, or just advance replace. lol
