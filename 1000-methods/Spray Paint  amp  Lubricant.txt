1. Get yourself the UPC of some rustoleum paint  in the color of your choice (walk around a store)
2. Head on over here http://www.rustoleum.com/CBGCorporate.asp?sn=cu
3. Click the offices tab and verify that they are not within 50 miles of you (or they will send some people to pick up the can)
4. Email them about your "Defective" Spraypaint and how when you attempted to spray it the paint just kind of fell out the nozzle or that the can had no pressure and did nothing when you tried to spray it
5. They will apologize then send you a coupon for some spray paint (~$6 value!)

Note: Occasionally they wil ask for a receipt, just rummage thru the garbage at home depot

Change the excuse as you see fit.

Also this will work with lubricants.... No not that kind... the WD40 kind
