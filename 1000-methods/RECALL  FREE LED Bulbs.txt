UPDATE: Well, looks like the recall is over or the stocks are low. I filled out a recall page and haven't heard anything from them the past week; others seem to reporting the same thing.


This isn't even SE, it's filling out a form and receiving bulbs!!! :D

Recall page: http://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2013/LED-Light-Bulbs-Recalled-by-Lighting-Science-Group/

Link to the recall page of company: http://www.lsgc.com/recall/

Go to the website, Fill out the necessary info.

Here is the info I used:


Purchase Location: Home Depot
Choose any of the bulbs containing ECS in the item name.
Quantity: Any 
Manufacture Code: L5110CH
Est. Price: >$150


Lot info and other necessary info can be found on the recall page.

You will get an e-mail from a girl saying to ship them back but I didn't and 10 bulbs just appeared in my mail.

CAUTION:

> More than four bulbs and the box gets larger.
> They have a small recall/support group so excessive rape will arouse suspicion.
