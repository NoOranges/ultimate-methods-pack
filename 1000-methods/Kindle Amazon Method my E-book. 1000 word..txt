markargin&#8217;s How to SE Amazon Kindles the Complete Tutorial

First you will need to download hotspotshield: http://hotspotshield.com/
Then you must run it every time before doing an SE for safety purposes.
Remember to use hotspot shield throughout all of your SE!!


Once you have hotspotshield running we can begin the SE.


First go to your local 7-11 and buy a vanilla visa 25$ prepaid VCC. If you don&#8217;t have a 7-11 close by try CVS pharmacy. PM if you need one.

Once you get a hold of the VCC go ahead and create an email address. I use Hotmail.com because you can create a valid email address really quickly. 

After creating an email address go to amazon.com and create a new account using that email address. Create a password and put in the name you want to use for the SE. It is useful to put all the info in a notepad document so you don&#8217;t have to remember it.

After you create your amazon account click on &#8220;your account&#8221; in the top right corner, then click on manage your kindle on the right hand side. Then click on register your kindle device and you should have a place to put in your kindle serial number. Here I will be teaching you how to SE a kindle fire so we will use a kindle fire serial.

Find a kindle fire serial if you don&#8217;t have one on hand then use this one: D01EB0A0146501AJ. Simply replace the last 3 characters (1AJ) with random letters until you get the device successfully registered.

Once you have done that click on &#8220;your account&#8221; again on the top right corner and navigate to manage payment options. Click to add a new Card and you should have a window open to put in your Card number and billing address. This is where the vcc comes into play.

Go ahead and visit the website vanillavisa.com. Click on the vanilla visa gift card tab, and put in your card info. Then on the left side you will see register this card, click on that. You will have a window open to put in your zip code. This is very important otherwise the VCC will not go through. Put in the zip code of the address you will be SEing the kindle to. Once that is done go back to your amazon account.

On your amazon account, fill out the card info including its number and expiration date. The cardholders name must match the name you put in your Amazon account when registering so make sure it&#8217;s the same. Put the billing address as the address you will be SEing the kindle too and make sure the zip code matches the zip code you registered your VCC with.

Now that you have your kindle registered and your VCC on file its time to do the fun part! The call.

Go and get your phone and call this number (make sure to put the *67 in front to hide your number):
*6718662161072 That is the number for the Amazon support, they work 24/7 in the US.

Have all your info ready on you notepad file because it makes things much more easier (including your name, email address, billing address, VCC)

Now the first thing they will ask you to do is provide them with an order number or an email address. Since we don&#8217;t have an order number give them your email address. They will make you verify your name and sometimes address, simply read what you have in your notepad.

Then they will ask you &#8220;what can we help you with today&#8221; 
You say: &#8220;I called in about 10 minutes ago about a defective kindle with screen problems but got disconnected while I was on hold&#8221;

They will apologize that you got disconnected and might ask you to give them more info about the defective kindle. Say:&#8221; I received the kindle as a gift and am having screen problems. My screen has some sort of discoloration and vertical lines going through it&#8221;

The rep should transfer you to the kindle department. They will ask you the same thing and you should say the same thing &#8220; I received the kindle as a gift about a month ago and started having issues with the screen. I called you guys 15 minutes ago and you had me register the defective kindle on my account and had me do a hard reset. However, that didn&#8217;t seem to help with the screen issue&#8221;.

The rep might ask you to perform another hard reset, just go with it and tell him that youre still experiencing the same problem.

If all goes well then he should either transfer you to the replacement department or start on the replacement himself. 

Whenever they start on a replacement they will ask you to verify your last 4 digits of the CC and the expiration date. They will also ask you to verify your billing address. When they ask you for the shipping address say it&#8217;s the same as the billing one.

If you have registered the VCC on vanillavisa.com it should go through no problem, and the replacement should show up as &#8220;shipping soon&#8221; on your amazon account in the &#8220;your orders&#8221; tab.


Its THAT simple to SE amazon. Once the replacement processes you can go back on vanillavisa.com and check your balance on the card. You should see a 1$ hold on the account so you&#8217;ll have 30 days to spend the remaining 24$ on your gift card.
