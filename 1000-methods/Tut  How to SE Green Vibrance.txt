Green Vibrance is some good stuff it just makes you feel really energised and healthier. This is the method to SE green Vibrance.

Green Vibrance is sold in many different tubs, choose which one you want. You'll usually get a 15 single serving packets when trying to SE any tub above 30-days. 
I decided to email them about the 30-day Green Vibrance notifying them that it didn't last the 30-days. Then depending on who you get they will send it to you through the post without supplying a receipt or any proof, which will probably change.

I've decided instead of explaining anything else I will just paste in my email logs.

I brought Green Vibrance 30-Day from a store in the US. When I went back to the UK I opened it up and half of the powder was missing. Now I can't return the product to the store. Could you possibly help me out?

Thank You

I apologize for the delay in responding to your e-mail.  We have had a many complaints about the bottle size of the Green Vibrance and this will be changing within the next few months.   Over the past 6 &#8211; 8 months we have had a few formula changes, adding as well as increasing some ingredients.  These formula changes caused the need for a larger jar, and so we went with this current bottle size because the price was right.  We realize now that this was a mistake and has caused people to believe that we are intentionally shorting the product.  The amount of Green Vibrance in the container is 30 full scoop servings, but because of the size of the container the product only fills Â½ the bottle.   As I said, it is in the works to go to a smaller container, but I do apologize for the perception that is given with the size of the bottle.
If you find, after using the bottle of Green Vibrance, that there are not 30 servings, please contact me and I&#8217;ll see what I can do to remedy this for you.
 
Thank you,

Thank You, for replying promptly but there wasn't 30 servings in the bottle.

Oh boy, I'm surprised! Even though we have had complaints about the bottle size, there has always been the full amount of product in the container.  If you would like to send me your address, I would be happy to send you a box of individual serving packets, they come 15 packets in a box and this should make up for what you are shorted.

Thank you,
