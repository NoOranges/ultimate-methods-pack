Zowie is a pretty unknown company that specializes in gaming gear like mouse's keyboards and headsets.
All of their products are SE able. They require receipt but don't verify it.

1. Choose product. 
2. Contact company.
3. Complain about the product. I wont be going into much detail since I'm still doing them on a monthly basis so I don't want it to get raped. The mouse pads, skatez and camade are the easiest to SE since they don't need the product back. The headsets, keyboards and mice are more difficult since you need a serial number. These are really easy to find I'll post a couple. They want you to return the product but its pretty easy to ask for AR. They don't require vcc so it isn't that hard.

So yeah first 5 serials are on me but like I said they arent hard to find. Almost every review/video shows it clearly visible.
