I looked around and didn't see a method posted for this, so I decided to share mine.

1. Find a case you want from here.

2. Go to their contact page and tell them something along the lines of how the case does not charge your phone.

3. They should reply offering you a replacement right away after giving them a receipt and some other basic info. The email should look like this.

4. Give them your real address, name, the model/color you picked from earlier, and send them an Amazon receipt using any generator.

5. They will reply confirming your replacement with an email like this. You don't need to return anything, they don't bill.

Enjoy your case.
