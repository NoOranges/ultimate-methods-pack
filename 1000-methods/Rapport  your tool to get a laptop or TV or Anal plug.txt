People keep asking me how to get laptops and TV's, but these items very rarely have cookie cutter methods.  If they did they'd get raped and the method would be ruined, so many people(used to at least) post great tuts that worked flawlessly a dozen times  and then they got flamed by hundreds of people because the company caught on.  This is my universal method that can't be saturated because you have to be an awesomely socially manipulative asshole, and honestly maybe one in one hundred people on here really are :)  This isn't a tut that lists a company, just the way I get almost everything and anything.  My conversation starters/examples are just examples, the more you practice this the better you'll get at knowing how to act for different types of reps.
 
-Call up with a serial regged to you or a lot of product knowledge claiming that you're having a very common problem that results in a replacement, find these problems in tech forums.  Briefly explain your tech challenged parents/adorable friend asked you to order them the best device of this type and you went with this unit.  Rattle off a few reasons to make the rep feel good.
 
-Use a funny(but real) name, or a name that's a conversation starter.  I used to use Richard Wood but I went by Dick. "Just don't call me by my full name unless you mean it darling" :D  If they don't chuckle and relax at the fun name(or whatever opening joke you use) hang up and try again.  Their job sucks and I'd say maybe one in eight reps are just plain dead inside, their job sucks and make sure to write down your name so you can use it later.
 
-Ask where they're based out of right away, then while they ask your name, serial, details, etc google where they're at.  Also find out how long they've worked there, if they're really new hang up and try again, they won't have the confidence/skills to bend the rules.
 
-Exclaim once they're "looking up your account" how your grandma(or someone close/adorable) lives there and you used to go there all the time and absolutely loved it.  Google can tell you what attractions you went to, where that special hot dog stand was, about that flood that happened when you visited that one time, the bar where you first kissed a stranger(the one that advertises "cheapest drinks"), all that shit.  You're now building rapport, relating to them and on the path to becoming their friend.
*You also want to emulate their language and accent if you can, so when you first amaze them by actually knowing their bars or churches they'll say a word "Awesome", "Excellent", "Badass", "bodacious", that's now your word to use when they make you happy, reward them with the positive word from their schema.  This is one of those depressingly powerful psych things that makes people seem weak-minded...
 
-NEVER interrupt them while they tell stories unless they interrupt a lot too, how they order who speaks when reflects their friends so if you reflect that you're a more personable friend.  Get them to open up and talk about their life there and how the city has grown/evolved.  If they just moved there ask where they grew up/went to college/had an abortion/whatever and repeat step 2+3 ;)
 
-Your goal is to have one of those amazing conversations with them that that makes time fly and ladies swoon, be interested, funny, and like a big brother to them.  Teach them about the best local bars/churches/gyms(that google showed you), empathize with the relationship stories they might tell and match them with your own and how you cunningly solved the problems, ask about the show you "missed" last month when their fave band played, keep adding funny quips and just keep them talking to you.  If they get distracted and ask for more info say you're looking for it and change the subject to something more interesting to them.  "Lemme find that in my giant folder fed fat with receipts, Really, you live in Iowa and you don't golf, what on earth do you do there instead?  Oh really?  My cousin and I used to do that too, how could I have forgotten that activity!  blah blah blah.  Every so often work in a story about your parents/adorable friends lack of technical aptitude to build a little sympathy for them.
 
-If you're super awesome two hours will go by pretty quickly since you'll both be having fun, you're waiting for them to say "hold a second" while they're in the middle of a story.  That means their manager just noticed that they've been laughing on the phone for hours and asked wtf.
 
-Now it's time to cash in all that rapport you've been building by turning it into empathy.  Be amazed that so much time passed right when they get back, be worried about how the person you're helping told you that their attempt to call was the worst experience of their life and that's why they had you call.  Be surprised that you had such a great time and ask if there's a douchebag that works there that you friend might have talked to who hassled them, maybe drop the name of the rep you got before if you had to call back because the first rep was dead inside. If they start gossiping then that wasn't their manager and keep building rapport, if they apologize and move forward then you're set.  The rep will be relieved that they don't have to make the switch to professional with their new favorite person and be happy that they now get to help you while making up for some other shitty rep by giving you outstanding service.
 
-By now most times(90%+) I'll get a replacement right away, the reps 1/2 in trouble, needs to resolve the problem quickly, and loves the fuck out of me plus they know it's a common issue.  Occasionally I get a hardass by the rules person, that means it's time to work negative emotions.  Up until now everything you've brought has been positive and awesome so when you become disgruntled they&#8217;ll notice and want to go back to you being fun.  My buddy full out rages but I think it's faster/kinder to half rage/half bemoan that this is what your friend ran into and challenge them to be better than that douchebag rep.
*11/27/12 update - What I do these days is never touch the negative emotions and instead say something like "I understand your hands are locked by that dick company, but could ya pass me on to the coolest manager and put in a good word?  My mentally retarded polio ridden brother really can't hang sane without his macbook...".  That pretty much always works since the manager they pick knows them and knows they're normally a dick so you must be a really important customer.  
 
The main three main complaints I hear about this are:
A: "This is hard."  
It's kinda easy and a great skill that will help you in all walks of life.  Try to learn beatboxing, THAT'S FUCKING HARD!

B: "This takes too long"  Two hours for a 1500$ toy, what other skill do you have that makes you 750$ an hour?

C: "TL: DR"  That's unfortunate for you, I like literate people....
Remember, SE is just sales.  You're selling an illusion, have fun with it :)
