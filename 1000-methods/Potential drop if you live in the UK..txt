I'm not sure if it's the right section to post this, but here goes.
ByBox is a company in the UK which has over 400 lockers all over the country. They are usually located near supermarkets, petrol stations, storage locations, shopping centers, etc. In my town, I have one near Tesco. They essentially give you an address to ship to and you put a number in the address so that they know it's for you. Once they receive it, they will put it in your local selected locker and give you a PIN code to enter to the locker to collect the parcel. 

However, it's not completely free, but it is very cheap. The first five deliveries altogether cost JUST £2. I just create a new account each time because of this. If you have a ByBox nearby, this could be useful.
