Basically, I've been doing this shit for almost 12 years, when I got my first gaming system.. It's mostly known, as it's common sense, but I figured I'd let everyone know who didn't think of it


Say you have a badly scratched Disc and your Xbox/Ps3/Wii/Dvdplayer/etc isn't picking it up

Go to a Redbox/Blockbuster/etc, rent your game

Replace the disc with yours, keep the other one.
