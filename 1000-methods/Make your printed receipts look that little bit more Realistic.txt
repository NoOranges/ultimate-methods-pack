Hey guys, this is my first tutorial so hope you find it useful.

So weve all used a receipt maker in the past, but if u want to go the extra step and make it that little bit more realistic.

Follow these steps.
So im going to show you how to get from this:
258
To this:
259

Firstly, go to http://www.customreceipt.com and create a recepit, 
now they dont have enough lines for alot of things ,so make a couple of more so you can photoshop that in later :) 

When your adding your store name and address , it might help googling the store name and getting its real address and putting it in. 
Add their phone number while your at it. If your worried the company will call them up ,change the number or something,  but im Sure they wouldnt bother.
If your real sneaky ,add your number and everything you get a call from an unknown in the next week or so, be like , "hello this is  how may i help you" 
hahah :P 

Also add other things , this might help make the recepit look a bit more real. 
Then print it out, Cut it very carefully, crumple it up like its been in your pocket, 
and what i did ,is i just just a little bit of water, just under a drop, and i smudged it where the text is and on the corner. 
Be like sorry for the smudges it was a hot day , i was all sweaty and stuff, this just keeps the relationship between you and the rep pretty casual :)

Let it dry, Scan it and voila, it looks like mine. 
The other thing you could do is get a receipt from any electronics store, and have a PSD ready for editing for whenever you need it .

Sorry for the lack of pictures, i meant to add it but Im feeling pretty lazy today :P
