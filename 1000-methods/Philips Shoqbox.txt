Philips Shoqbox



1. Go on Philips live chat.
2. Complain about how your Shoqbox isnt working anymore. ( no sound, doesnt pair with phone )
3. Complete the troubleshooting.
4. When asked for receipt use AstroProof.
5. Change some numbers of the serial posted below.

There are different models of shoqbox's. I got the SB7200.
Serial: PT1A1246000013

They are pretty good speakers. Pretty rigid you can throw them at a wall and it will still work. You can pause/skip tracks by waving with your hand.

Good luck!
