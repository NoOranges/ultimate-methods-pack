I got my lava lamp today, so boss.
I was like why the hell not, here's the extremely easy method I used. Try not to saturate this. k? ;)

This is the company you're going to SE: http://www.lavalamp.com

Basically, you want to pick out the lava lamp you want here. I got this one.

Now that you found the one you want, click on "Contact Us" at the top. Fill out the form with the required info ONLY and then write something like this: nocopypastaforyou ;)

(don't copy word for word or I'll find you and rape you)

You should get a reply in a day or so with this:
Please check to see if the bulb is ok.  If not I can send you a new one.

Say you already tried a new bulb and that didn't help.

Then you will get this email:
Send me your model # and address and we will replace.

Now be a noob and say something like "Is that the product number?"

You should get this reply:
Please provide the following:

Your address/phone number
Item#
Place of Purchase
Date Purchased
Lot# (which is located on the top of the bottle cap)

We will send a replacement

Now you can go ahead and reply with the info they are asking for. For the lot#, you can either say it's faded and you can't read it OR use this (ONLY IF YOU ARE GETTING THE BLUE/WHITE ONE): 11092501 (don't saturate that lot# people).

And in about 2 weeks, you should get your new lava lamp!

Enjoy it. ;)
