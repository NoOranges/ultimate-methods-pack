How to get free discs from Lovefilm!

I am not responsible for anything you do with this information!

UK only - sorry US :P
This tutorial is confirmed to work, as i have done this myself for ages! I wanted to keep this short and sweet, if you dont understand, please ask! :) i will try to help!


Step 1:
Get the discs you want from the website

Step 2:
Wait around a week

Step 3:
Go to 'Report a problem' on the site and say they were lost in the post.

Step 4:
Repeat for each disc

They will then send you your next discs!! Simple as that! 

But be careful, if you do this too much, they catch on and close your account for an unreliable postal service!
