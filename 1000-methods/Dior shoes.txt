They are very iffy and seems there not very consiest in the way they operate. 
Ie what might work for one user may not work for another. 



So I'll keep it general. 
First of they are arseholes don't bother with Incovince caused or you have a meeting or anything seems they don't care very much about there customers. 

This is only tested in EU but should be the same worldwide. 

First of all they will honor warrenty for products in season. 
Second mutherfuckers will verify everything. 




So first thing contact them saying the shoes are to big. 
They will ask for which shoes and recipt. 
Provide both. 


Then setup box or cross ship. They won't require VCC for cross. 

Pretty good since there shoes sell for about <£500 on eBay.
