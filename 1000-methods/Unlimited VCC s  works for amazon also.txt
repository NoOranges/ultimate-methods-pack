Today, I will be sharing a method I have wanted to show you guys for a while now, just been too lazy to type it up.

This will get you unlimited amount of VCC's you can open and close as much as you like, and they are all tied to one account. And since Amazon refunds you within 15 minutes of taking the money, I have used the same $3.52 getting the last 15+ kindles. Have been using this since January.

All you do is sign up for a Netspend account at http://netspend.com . Put a few dollars on it (you can figure that out) and bam. There you have unlimited VCC's. Netspend has been my best friend because I have used these VCC's at multiple places and also, you can change your address as many times as you want, when ever you want. So here is a break down of how it works...

I have $3 on my account, I want to have a kindle sent to address A1. I change my address in netspend to match A1, I open a new VCC, go SE the kindle. They send it. wait 10 minutes, receive refund to account. Go back to netspend, change my address to B2, open a new VCC, SE another kindle to address B2. They send it. Wait 10 minutes, receive refund... And so on... This way your address never gets saturated, and you can have as many VCC's as your little heart desires. You can only have 5 or 6 open at a time, but you can close them and open more.... 

Enjoy.

This is the list inside your account in Net Spend. Ones that say expired are the ones I already closed.
