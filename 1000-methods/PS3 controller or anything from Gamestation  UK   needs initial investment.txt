This is how I got 3 PS3 controllers and I'm sure I could get more. In theory this should work for anything Pre-owned at either Game or Gamestation.

So I placed an order online for 1 Pre-owned PS3 controller.

When the first one came I rang and asked where it was. (+1 controller).
They said it got lost in the post so they sent another.

When the second one came I rang and said this is crap...it cannot be used! It is damaged I'm disgusted. They said send it back and we shall replace it. (+2 controller)

I rang again and said what's the status with my controller?
They said they hadn't received it.

This is the trickiest bit...and I sort of feel mean.

GO MENTAL!!! Slowly but surely get more angry and demand remuneration. (by this point you have been without your controller for a month!!!) Tell them all sorts...I went with I want a new (not pre-owned) controller as well as the pre-owned one you have not had in over a month! Tell them you bought a PS3 in store from them and the controller was messed up so you thought you would replace it online...as you got a cheap deal you didn't mind paying the extra for a controller for it....but your entire purchase has been a let down as you havent been able to play since you got the thing!!!

I got offered a new controller and a £10 game reward card.

I think they key is to be realistically angry...first time calling you would be a bit peeved. Second time, slightly annoyed third time and over a month wait...SEND ME MY FUCKING CONTROLLER!!!

Let me know how you get on.
