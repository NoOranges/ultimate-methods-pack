Black Berry play book method updated 


Updated By Rucka Rucka Ali








1. obtain a serial for the playbook from ebay or cragis list
message the selling and say something  like "hello my name is bob and i would like to get your playbook. can you provide me the playbook serial number to verify it still in warranty.


2. check the serial at http://us.blackberry.com/support/playbook-support/contact.jps. 
3. you what to call bb and say that your tablet is powering on and not showing any thing on the screen. they will send u a few email when they send you to rma.
This is the updated part
4. when you receive you box take all the itmes  out on the box and place the bottom foam back in  the box. you should see a long pouch that u put playbook in stick your hand in the bag and rip the bag. what i like to do is whipe the bag so they dont have finger prints on the bag.


5. place the bag over the foam thats in the box then place the included papers and then the smaller part of the foam. close the box and seal it with the Stop brake sticker. 
6. cut the sticker open the box and turn the papers and little foam to make it seem like some 1 was in a hurry.


7. table the box closed and use the new fedex bag they now include. place the box in the bag seal it and call fedex.


8. place the box in the new fedex bag bag and find a good place to cut it and reseal it


9. you should get a call from bb stateing your bb is not in the box .tell them your did what the box told you to do. also try and say mm question can u tell me how the box looks. if they tell you it was taped and where the papers was say something like this 
"i did not tape the box i use the stop sticker and the papers was in the bottom of the box"
