Lets rephrase what I've said earlier. Because a lot of people have been bitching at me because they can't SE.

1) I did fail at SEing a Vita. But that was my first method. This is a second method I made for another go around but never got to it.

2)For all of you low posts, noobs that have the audacity to come in here and criticize my method, I'd like to see you try and SE any thing worth more than $200. (no kindles, or anything from Phillips)

3) I didnt say copy it verbatim...re-word it and play around with it. Its just used as a base.

Proof that this isn't the failed method. This one is OBVIOUSLY different from the one I failed with below.
