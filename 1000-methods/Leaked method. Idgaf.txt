*flashback*

Things to know
*Your a Student
*Your Lactose Intolerant

1.  You woke up bright and early to go through your daily routine. You were going to go to school like every day and stopped by Starbucks. You love Starbucks, proven by the fact that you go there every day.  You order a frap but specifically tell them to not use milk since you are lactose intolerant. You get your frap and go to school. Not too long later you start breaking out with hives. You go and see the school nurse, who calls your parents. Your parents take you to the doctors and you get a shot. Apparently they put milk in your drink!

a. Your mom is furious! She wants Starbucks to pay the doctor bill, inconvenience, and a refund for the product. She says she will never go or take you to Starbucks again if they do not reimburse you.

b. You paid the bill and your fine paying it. You just want a reimbursement or something to cover the cost of the frap and the inconvience caused through the ordeal.

2.  Small talk your way until you get the item(s) that you want

Congratulations. You just got a $45 Gift Card. YIPIEE!!!.
