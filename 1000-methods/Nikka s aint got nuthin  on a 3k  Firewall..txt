Alright, so go here;
https://www(addafuckingdothere)barracuda.com/
Get a serial Number that's valid(and in warranty.!), and get a vcc (They didn't charge my vcc that much (15$) ) I don't know why. 

Point is they offer INSTANT replacement Overnight AR when you say your shit isn't working.
Contact them, and obviously say shit isn't going according to plan, and your shit isn't working. Remember, to complain, complain, oh, and complain. :) 
Double dip and don't send shit back. GG Barracuda?

Gonna try to release every tues/friday. :)
