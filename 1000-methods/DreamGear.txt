Hello,iNK again with another method. This one for a company named DreamGear.

They make gaming accessories like controller and such. So far I have got 2 Ps3 controllers and a WarBeast guitar from them. 


What you will need-

POP for more expensive products
Possibly a serial after everyone rapes them.


Step 1. Go to there contact page here- http://www.dreamgear.net/customer-service and either email or phone them. (the wait time on phone is only like 5 minutes and you can get in about 2 emails a day if you're fast.)

Step 2. Tell them that the product doesn't work,
It won't sync up
Buttons are stiff
It's unresponsive
Dies randomly
Tried to touch your butthole


Step 3. Troubleshoot- It will take anywhere from 1-3 emails depending on cost of product.

Step 4. Get a refund or have them ship you a new product.
They, like almost all companies, have advanced replacement.

Step 5. After you get there product,don't forget to send the old one back.

Step 6. Just kidding.

Step 7. Enjoy your new gaming accessory!
