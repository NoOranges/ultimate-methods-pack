So I found this code on one of the Canadians deal forums and basically Zip.ca is like any other online DVD/Blu-ray rental place, with this deal you get 3 dvd's out at a time and Unlimited monthly....so the trick is to report that you have not gotten the Disk in the mail and they should just write it off, because I got 3 dvd's yesterday and the package had Zip.ca all over it and you can feel that there is a DVD in it, that just attracts someone to steal it so they know this will happen over time when they ship items out .

Step 5: Put in your CC(I do not know if Pre-paid works you can try it)

Step 6: staring Losing all those Blu-rays and DVD's then claim you have not gotten them or you sent them back allready!
So that's it, all you need to do now is start adding movies to your Zip List and wait a day or two until they start shipping it to you and then start losing the Blu-rays and DVD's if you know what I mean:)
