I will make this METHOD very clear, for the 100 threads that seem to be popping up, refer to this, and post your concerns here, I will outline the basic structure of how to do this (basic as fuck) method, for people with not many brain cells. 


1. You go to Amazon.com/Amazon.co.uk/Amazon.ca and purchase your desired Item.

Item limits to not get signed
- US $300
- UK £200
- CA ???(I guess its the same as US)

2. You purchase the item, hopefully I do not need to explain this.

3. You select items which are either,
- Sold by Amazon.com Directly
- Fulfilled by Amazon.com

4. This is key especially for UK
- You select super saver delivery, so you get the retarded couriers, that do not track your item.

5. You do not answer the door when your item arrives(preferred - makes calling amazon easier) - They will then leave it outside your house and you just walk out after they leave and take it
OR You answer the door, just hoping they don't ask you to sign

6. You call amazon a few days later, and say where is my item

7. They will say tracking says delivered, and some couriers, say what happened to the item e.g It was left outside, this is great as then it looks like its stolen, so they will say they will replace the item.

8. You say something along the lines of 'Oh I can't be bothered with this, I've found a better deal anyway, can I have a refund instead?' They will agree.

9. Enjoy your free shit.

(You can also sign for larger items 2k+ and then just say they were signed by someone else, and you do not know who done it, they will investigate but you will still get your shit.)

(If I now see one more thread asking about amazon i will flame the **** out of you)

Enjoy!
