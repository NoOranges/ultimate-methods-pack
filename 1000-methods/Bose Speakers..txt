I found this out a little while ago and have been successful in every attempt.
I'm not going to spoonfeed you guys here,
http://www.usrecallnews.com/2012/11/bose-recalls-dual-voltage-
Basically if your in the US your going to need to come up with an excuse as the why this speaker was connected to a 220~240VRMS power source

most places outside of the US, just come up with a story as to how an why the unit was from the US, (very easy)
as your electricity is already at 240V

If your in the US, your going to need to use an excuse such as, 

Using a socket outlet in a caravan/RV (sometimes 240V depending on the maker)
Using a socket outlet in a Lab that had a constant 240V filtered wave for delicate machines.
using a socket outlet from a transformer that steps up to 240V. (actually quite common)

Just use your imagination and maybe some research into places 240V is found in the US and go from there.


Once you have your story, ring up bose and tell them how your bass module or "sub" caught on fire and your other speakers were next to it/ontop of it. 

If they ask you to send it back tell them how it was all in full flames by the times you realized that it caught fire and you threw what was left away as it was all covered in soot and ash.

The recall webpage will inform you quite a bit so if you haven't read it go read it.

pretty straight forward.
