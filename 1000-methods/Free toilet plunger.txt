So easy to SE. BTW These are great toys! Me and my bro have "sword" fights with these! 

Method (Should work on any brand):

1. Search "toilet plungers brands" on google.

2. Choose a company.

3. Contact them. Say it is broken, the plunger head thing pulled off while using it to clog a massive shit blah blah blah.

4. If they don't ask you to send it in skip to number five. If they do just say it touched poop and is dangerous to send poop through     mail.

5. Have plunger battles with people.
