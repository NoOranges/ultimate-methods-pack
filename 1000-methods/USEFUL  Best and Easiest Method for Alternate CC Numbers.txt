Here's a great way to get new card numbers to use on Amazon... This only works for Bank of America, as far as I know, but it may for other banks. Basically, you have Bank of America generate you a different credit card number. When that second card number gets billed, it automatically charges your actual credit card, with no hassle! So if you're blacklisted by Amazon, or anything of the sort, you don't have to pay a fee to get a new credit card from your bank, you can just use this great feature!
