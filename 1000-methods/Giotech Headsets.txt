This is a very tricky SE. They've only agreed to give me a headset only so far.

http://www.gioteck.com is their website.

1. Contact them detailing a fault in their headset.
2. Give them an excuse why you need the headset immediately. Request a cross-ship.
3. As a gesture of goodwill, they will agree to send you the headset only.
4. Make your way through until you get the full box.

Make sure you state that you're trying this if you wish to SE this company. I must warn you; they can be easily patched.
