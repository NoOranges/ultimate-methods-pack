Go to a store that sells your desired laptop.

Take a photo of the tag and service tag.

Fill out the ownership transfer.

For the previous info, use the stores dox (Didn't know if word fits but yeah i used it so deal with it) IE: Address post code etc.

Make a fake name for the name, but for the email you want it to look like a senior employees work contact email.  @walmart.com etc

And there you have it.


Note: This has only been tested in AU, and it appears certain companies register their demo models.
