Im releasing this method to everyone because im now done and have gotten everything transferred.

First of all you need to be eligible for scroll of res (being inactive since 4th march). Make a friend send you the scroll of res and use  your free char transfer on a character  or boost to lvl 80 + realm transfer. at the same time you do that create a ticket saying that you moved the wrong character and you want to move another one, after you create the ticket call blizzard up on this number using skype 
+448000288246.
Tell them on the phone that you moved the wrong character and ure wondering if they can help you out. Now get a character you want transfered/boosted and tell them on the phone what spec you want etc. If they tell you they cant help you call them again.

Now this is the good part. he will revert your scroll of res rewards, you will still be able to move one character using the service. BUT!! do not use it before they respond on ure ticket. Because they can see if you claimed ure rewards or not. You might fail and only get 2, even 1 maybe. But ure probably gonna get 3. Ive done this and i can confirm its working.
