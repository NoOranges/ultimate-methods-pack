So yea. This isnt so hard. Both me and a friend of mine made this up while we were at Taco Bell. We have done it numerous times at multiple Taco Bell's and it ALWAYS works..


                Oh yea, be nice, this is my second tutorial I've done.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Go to a Taco Bell with a friend

Have your friend order what he wants.... For example: "I would like two Volcano Taco's and a Baja Blast please!"

When you and your friend sit down, open whatever you bought.

Have your friend (or you) go to the cashier (without the food) and say something like " I ordered the two volcano tacos without tomatoes as I'm highly allergic to them".. They cant say no, it's as simple as that.

The cashier will order whatever food you got (without the tomatoes etc).. Your friend gives you the original order, he gets the new one.

???

Profit


Have fun ;)


***Oh yea, if your nice, split the price with your friend prior to going.. If you think the totals gonna be 5 dollars, give him $2.50 ;)
