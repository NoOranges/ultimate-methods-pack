Alright, I did this 5 times already, so here we go:

1. Get Skype
2. Call (866)-543-5435 (totally free)
3. Wait until you get the second menu
4. For Battlefield 3, press 1
5. Wait for a rep
6. Tell them that you bought Battlefield 3 and it doesn't work and you wanted to play with your friend so badly. You bought it together, his works and yours don't
7. ???
8. Profit

Tips!

Use a chinese voice (or something foreign)
When they tell you hold for a minute, and you went for the chinese voice, make sure you start talking chinese with your mom, dad or someone. (not real chinese lol, but just make up words)
If they ask for a key (they won't) then use this: 2X9W-UAZ7-8A84-XG97-7B7C
