Basically all companies that use real corks fear "cork taint", where the cork is tainted with foreign substances from the third world(Portugal) where it's grown and it fucks up the liquor taste. It's considered to affect 3-15% of all bottles and is apparently the shame of the industry, being dependent on Portuguese... 

So taint a cork, the two ways I use are either dip the cork in sugar water and leave it behind your fridge for a week until it's moldy, clean it up so it looks good, and pop it back in the bottle; or, the faster way is to dip it in gasoline, let it sit outside for a day or two, shatter the bottle(so they can't test residue), and say your buddy dropped it gagging when he tasted that filth. When you call, the larger places will offer you a refund usually with a little extra but small places will offer to have their local agent(sales person) meet you and give you a few free bottles. The agent has always checked my ID even though I'm pretty obviously over 21 and collected the bottle for "testing" or just the cork if I used the shatter tale. 

Larger companies don't want that level of shitty press and small companies genuinely love their product so they'll defend it to the death :D  My best return from this was a full cask of small batch rye bourbon, don't be afraid to aim high!

It helps a lot if you know about the liquor you're calling about, makes you look like an awesome customer they don't want to lose.  Wikipedia can educate you quickly on how to talk about good scotch, bourbon, champagne, etc.  Also don't mention cork taint directly unless you can talk the shit out of the liquor, lead them to it with phrases like "it tasted awful and even the cork smelled like death" or "I've drank a lot of your drink but I've never seen a cork this dark in color, did you switch corks?"
