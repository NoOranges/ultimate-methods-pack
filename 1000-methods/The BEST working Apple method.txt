First off, you are going to need some balls for this. You will be dealing directly with the police. It is VERY RISKY but the payoff is usually well worth it!


This is my method for most companies


-----Tip* Pretending to be a teenage girl (16-18 is best! So if you've got a girlfriend (or your mom, LOL.) get them in on it to call in! OR you could be classic and use your own name. -----


> Get the serial number AND imei of your selected apple device.
Call in to Apple (calling is MUCH better than emailing in!) and explain your problem with 'your' Apple product. They will try troubleshooting in most cases, and at the end, tell them nothing is working. This is the point where they will send you a box for it.


> Do the regular box method as usual. Wait a few days, call in and say that you are inquiring about the repair status. They will tell you that it was missing and box has been tampered with on arrival. Tell them you are going to call the police and ask them to start an investigation if possible. They will say okay, and be in contact with you via phone and/or email.


> At this point, either go in to your local 'copshop' (the station/downtown) OR call in to them and say you shipped your apple (PRODUCT) away for repair and Apple said it was missing on arrival and the box looked like it was tampered with. You would like to report it stolen. -Police in different areas do everything differently- I just went in to mine and they told me to wait and an officer would be with me, he came and took down all my information and etc.. Also give them any numbers Apple sends you and copies of any emails between you and Apple. They will be in contact with Apple and help in your advantage.


> Wait a little bit more, call in to the station and Apple every few days and ask what's going on with the case. After a bit (mine took just over two months!) Apple or the police will contact you and Apple will send you your replacement.

Enjoy :)
