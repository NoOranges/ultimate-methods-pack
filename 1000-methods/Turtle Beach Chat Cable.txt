Hello, all.

Last night, I emailed Turtle Beach since I had a legitimate issue but added a little bit of SE'ing skills to see what the outcome was. I emailed them the following "hello, i have had your X12's since last christmas, finally the cord that connects to your controller has broke. i was wondering if you could send me out a replacement cord for being a loyal customer. thanks!" 

I don't really care if you copy & paste it. I think this method would be prime at around this time since it's Christmas and most kids get their Turtle Beaches for Christmas. (inb4 i didnt get mine for xmas etc.) I told them that I bought it from eBay but I did provide a legitimate serial number. Here is what my SN looked like for my pair of X12's. SN: G2255838152##

Here is what their response looked like: http://gyazo.com/270a98ea6e314d7cbf0e8e66fdfb69ea.png
Thanks for reading and I hope this method works for you.
