Sup fella's. Decided to share a little method I use to make some extra dough.

1.Go to iOffer.com and create an account.
2.Buy  jewelry or ray-ban for 10-50 dollars.
3.Wait till you get the items. 
4. Sell the items on ebay/craigslist/marktplaats for 70-80% REAL retail with a receipt you just created.
5. Rinse and repeat for easy money.

Tips: - Don't meet the buyer at your house and don't give out to much of your own information. Either send the package or decide to meet at a public area {because you have bad experience in the past with buyers coming to your home}
- If you decide to do this only once shipping claim the items on paypal and get your money back.

The items I use for this are; 
 - Around March/April ray-bans or other sunglasses tend to go very well.
- At the end of the summer do belts. Don't do Louis Vuitton though, nobody is going to believe that. 
- Jewelry are allround items that sell pretty good all time of the year.
- Edit: Don't do watches that are originally waterproof. The fake ones will not be waterproof.
