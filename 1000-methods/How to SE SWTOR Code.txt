Gonna keep this guide short and simple. At the moment I can not verify if this works STILL, but I can guarantee that this worked 1 month ago as I did it a total of 3 times for friends.

Step 1: Create an Account on Swtor.com
Step 2: Fill out all your information etc.
Step 3: You MUST have these things.
1. A picture of the SWTOR BOX
2. A Picture of "your" SWTOR code

The box/case is self explanitory, but trouble arises with the code. Now there are many ways to find pictures of codes. But I suggest that when you find one, you do some photoshopping to it.

For Example My Code was XXXX-HHHH-PPPP-NNNN
What I would do would be to Crop out each segment and proceed to move it around so it indeed looks like this.

HHHH-NNNN-XXXX-PPPP

Step 4: After you have your pictures ready, Email the pictures and your story explaining that the code did not work to Support@swtor.com not sure if they ask for PoP now, but they did not when I did it. Now we just be patient and in the next day or 2 they should give you an email Apologizing and telling you that they have activated your account.

Sadly enough they do not seem to give out codes so this is probably better for people who actually want to try the game out. They also give you a complimentary 30 Days of playing time free just like those who bought the game.

EDIT: I have uploaded a complimentary Photo for example and for Editing to this Thread. This has already been used and I am not sure if they saved this info or not. Best thing to do would be to Crop one letter and to paste is over another to create yourself a new code altogether which is what was done here.
