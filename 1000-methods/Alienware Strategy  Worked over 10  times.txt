Okay now I hear that Alienware methods have become few and far between.

Well I'm going to give you guys a strategy that has never failed and if followed correctly by someone with some skill will work for them.

If your looking to be spoonfed just leave now you'll be disappointed.



First what your going to need is to get the service tag of the machine you wish to acquire. 
You must always make sure to get a tag with complete care, its a  hassle but is the backbone to the SE.
You guys should be smart enough to figure out how to register a tag in your alias name with complete care :D


After that its very easy, let your imagination run wild. Try think of some ways that an accident could occur where the laptop gets destroyed and you cant send it in or touch it.

Things that have worked for me.

Single dad spilt bleach on laptop while doing laundry i had it playing music at the time.

Dog had puppies right beside it under my bed and ruined the computer.

a septic line in my apartment broke and ruined half my closet and my computer was inside.

An old fluro lamp broke and leaked a bunch of goo onto the latptop, called an electrician round he said it was a carcinogenic chemical compound called PCP (it got left in lights thourghout the 70's and is since illegal) and had to dispose of it and clean up in a manner meeting national health and safety standards which meant discarding the laptop as it was a cancer risk since it was covered in the chemicals.


It's literally that easy once you have the right tag,

hope that helps some new comers as i've done more than my fair share of alienwares.
