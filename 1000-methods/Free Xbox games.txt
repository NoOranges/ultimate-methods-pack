Hey all,

I've decided to release my personal method on how to get free Xbox 360 games. Here is how to goes:

1, Pick a Microsoft game (Gears/Halo/Forza/etc)
2, Call Microsoft (Skype, it's free derp)
3, Press 1 and wait till you get transferred to a rep
4, Now tell him how you just spoke to a different rep, but you got disconnected. Tell him you just bought your game, like yesterday. You were playing it, BUT THEN SUDDENTLY your Xbox was making loud noises. You checked out the disc and it had round scratches. They are going to ask you if you moved your Xbox, act confused and say no. Two things can happen:


1: They are going to offer you a replacement. You must send them the disc, and they will send you a new disc, and since you just bought the game, they will do it for free.
2: They will charge like ~$15. You can either accept this or be like: "But the other rep told me since the game was so new, the replacement would be free." If they give you a hard time, tell them you how confused you are, since it costs them nothing and you gain nothing from it, etc etc. 
NOTE: This may take a few tries, so either be prepared to pay the small price or keep trying untill they accept.


Now they will give you instructions on how to send your disc. Just send a empty envelope, tamper with it a little bit, you know the drill. Send it in empty.
Call a few times to check in, and you will get your disc in no time.

Once you get your game. Call them and say you never got it. You will get another one.

Please don't overdo this or it will be patched before you know it.


Tested in:

Holland
US

Have fun, I'd love any kind of thanks you.
