Say you have a Knife Set called the 75th Anniversary Edition (super old, they don't make them anymore)

Claim that a knife broke when you were cutting whatever, literally snapped in half

They will send you an email back asking for your shipping information for them to send you out a brand new up to date set like this: http://www.amazon.com/Chicago-Cutlery-Landmark-14-Piece-Block/dp/B004IUOTNM

Enjoy your knifes, there actually super good knifes ha!

They don't ask for a picture, old knife, broken knife, anything.

Here is what I got in the mail:
