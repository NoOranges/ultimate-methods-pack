Okay so if you are unaware of the recent problems tesco has been facing with the "horse" meat dibacle have a look:

Now because I have never bough any meat in the past this wont work for me so I thought I'd pop in to my local and see if I can spot something else that I can get compensation for.

Low and behold, tesco baguette!

This might not work for everyone as certain stores have fixed this already but just buy a baguette that has a STICKER on the end.
The sticker is there to ensure the bread has passed their standards and what not but by having it there the customer cannot eat it!

So send them an e-mail:
customer.services@tesco.co.uk

The message should be the typical:

" I love your store in my area and blah blah but I can't enjoy your baguette's because of the sticker on the end".

Give it a day and they will CALL you and let you know they are going to fix it and will send you out a FREE £5 giftcard.


Option 2 is that you don't go in store and send them an e-mail anyway, chances are they'll call you anyway and offer you a free gift card.
