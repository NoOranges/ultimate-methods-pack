(MOSTLY ALREADY SATURATED, MAY BILL IF YOU SCREW UP)

I haven't contributed in forever, hell haven't even been on the SE scene in months really, but last time I was this company was really easy to get stuff from. I had a friend who managed to get like three Sound Stacks ($400 each) and two or three Sound Steps ($150 each).

The most they asked for was a receipt (Amazon) and possibly a serial which you can get with the normal ways. Just give em a reason its not working, maybe troubleshoot, and they should offer to send you an advanced replacement.

I'd suggest using a drop if you're worried, but I didn't always use one and have had no problems. If you have any questions, comments, concerns, just post here or PM me and I'll try to help ya out. Hope this helps some people out!
