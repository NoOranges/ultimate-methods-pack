Oy oy pricks! Shit seems stale here at the moment so I thought I would give you leachers something to fwap over.

So I thought I should share this as I always do this and it is pretty much key to my repeat products from one company.
In the U.K. most of the delivery companies that offer tracking (FedEx, DPD, Royal Mail) will have a customer service department that are ready and willing to help you if you aren't in for the day they deliver. I'm not going to baby you so here's what happened today for example.

I phoned a company that offer an hour slot to deliver, and said I would be out as there was an emergency I had to attend to, just leave it in my "green" bin and I'll grab it later. It's important you specify a bin but be quite loose with the description.

The guy said, "I'm sure we can sort that out" he then called the driver who said they would need a written authorisation....so I said I would tape it to the lid of my green bin (there are admittedly about 4 green bins on my driveway as I live in a flat) but I did no such thing and just waited.

The driver came, looked in the bins and couldn't find anything obviously, but proceeded to leave the package in my recycling bin. They usually do even if they don't find the note, (once they didn't so I ran out and said oh yeah I'll sign). I am now about to call them and follow up with "I'm home and the bin I specified still has trash in it but no parcel". They will inevitably call the driver who will specify the bin he left it in and I shall say "They empty that bin today so it's with the garbage men...That's why I told you a specific bin!!!" They will then tell me to get in touch with the company sending the parcel or they will take it from there.

B00m!
