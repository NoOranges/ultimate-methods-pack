This is a pretty basic tutorial on how I get some of my workout supplements.
Ill use http://www.gnc.com/product/index.jsp?productId=12076637 as an example.

You are going to either 
A. Go to the manufacturer
B. Go to a online store that has actual stores in your area.

Now the last time I did this shit I simply stated when I got home my nitric oxide has ants in it and it was still sealed so I tossed it. Thats what I told them and then I did another report under my neighbors name and address which weren't in town of the same exact thing so in turn they thought they had a bug problem. Sent me replacement supplements+alot more. Its pretty simple? 
- Come up with a decent excuse as to why the product is bad! If its liquid shit dont say the powder had ants or bugs know your shit
- If asked for a receipt just say you declined the receipt because you have never had a problem with it before and intended to use the product or just make one
- It would work better to file multiple claims if you use a bullshit excuse like my own
- Honestly this is all common sense you got this guys ;)

I did it with GNC, $100 whey protein. Worked perfectly!
