Officialy Feeding Dem Leechers

Hello guys, just let me inform you all that this method actually requires some brain, and has some degree of difficulty.

I actually landed doing a double SE.

What you need
- Half decent Photoshop skills
- Some luck
- A brain and some skills



1. So first thing you want to do is find someone offering contests on youtube or anywhere else giving away razer gear, there's a lot of them, and it's not hard to find. So what I did was I found one, and said to him I won a Razer Naga epic a few months back(hoping he hadn't kept a database from that far back) - Jackpot he hadn't, so I told him I have a problem with the Naga Epic, and it was double clicking all the time(I googled problems with Naga epic and this was quite common) - I also said Razer said I need you to help me with the RMA, he agreed, so he got in contact with Razer as he is sponsored by them, and quickly I was set.

2.  You can try saying you bought it from a shop but they will say return it to the shop, and if there unofficial shop(Ebay) they won't even bother accepting you, very difficult to get them to budge, they have annoying reps.

3. You fill out the RMA form for razer, they reply back saying do one of two things
- Cut the Naga and take picture 
OR - Send it to them with  - likely to not work.

4. If you want to do a standard box method then go ahead, but instead you can photoshop a picture and they will just replace it.
Referr to this if you want to use a picture with the wire cut: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JHbfbKhRxo

NOTE: You need the serial and the wire in the same picture.

5. They replace.

6. Enjoy your Naga EPIC!


Got there in the end.
