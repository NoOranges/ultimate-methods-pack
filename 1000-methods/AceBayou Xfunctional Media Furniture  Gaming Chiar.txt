This SE is for the chair in the tittle. You can most likely apply this to any other AceBayou product but keep in mind their policy may vary per-product or per-price. The chair I'm talking about is about $140-$200 worth so... yea. 

You Will Need:

A receipt/invoice; You can probably use a Amazon generated receipt as Amazon supplies their products but, like almost any other company, they might try to verify it. I gave them an invoice I edited myself that I received from an eBay seller for a product I purchase so about any invoice will work. 

Model Number; This  is a 5 digit number that is contained under the seats' barcode, which is the last 5 digit of the barcode. This number can obtained easily through Amazon. Just search for the product and scroll down until you see the model number. 

Picture of product and editing skills (optional) - This may be optional depending on what "your problem" is with their product. I told them their material was whack and that it teared off easily, which a course they wanted a picture of the damage area. So it just depends on what you tell them your problem is. Being as they have plug-ings, such as speakers, in their seats' you can come up with a whole lots of reasons as to why you're disappointed in their product. 

Getting your chair:

1. Go to any website that sells, such as eBay and Amazon, and looks for a AceBayou product you want. I chose a Xfunctional Media Furniture. Keep in mind that if you're going to want to use an Amazon generated receipt you might want to see what item AceBayou actually has on Amazon. 

2. Now once you have done so head to AceBayou.com and contact their support team, here.

3. Once in the 'contact support' page enter your information; name, email, feedback (problem). 

3.1. Write down an issue with your product; I told them I was disappointed with their product as they chair material ripped easily and that the speakers didn't work. 

Some issues you can use; Leg broke, speakers don't work, material rips off (will need picture), and so many other reasons. 

It also wouldn't hurt to let them know how you feel like you were ducked and that you are looking for a new chair to buy from a different manufacturer. 

4. You, at least I did, quickly receive an email asking for model number and proof of purchase. That's how easy it was for me, so I guess it just depends on your agent. 

Anyways so they might ask you more questions just answer them. Then give them your model number and proof of purchase when they ask for it. They will either tell you to send it in, or that they will send you a replacement and that they are so sorry.
 
If they tell you to send it in give them a reason why you need a replacement for or why you can't send it in, or just box them. If you get to the point where you have to box, I wouldn't suggest continuing. Just try again. Being as if you're going to box something that heavy you might as well go for something that is more expensive, like MPB. 

Bio-hazard: You were on the chair having anal sex when suddenly your anal started bleeding and it got on the chair. lol. 

If they send you a replacement first then you're done. 

If they ask for a picture you can tell them your camera is broken, or you don't have one, etc..

5. Enjoy new gaming chair, or profit?

__________________

I don't know what else to tell you or how else to put it; this is a simple SE. 

If it becomes saturated then you're obviously just using something that has been used so many times; ex: speakers dead. Come up with something new and it will never become saturated. And/or you can apply this to most other gaming chair manufacturers. 

Like all other companies this may not take long to get saturated so take them while you can. 

Avoid Erin; He's a dick. If you get him I will suggest resubmitting another support request as he won't budge at all. He will want a picture of the damaged product, even if you don't have a camera, after telling him you smashed your camera against the wall one drunken night.
