Alright, let's make it more unique. You know me, hell yeah!
To prevent saturation , i decided to release a encrypted message. Basically, if you decrypt whole of the code, you get to know the company name and you can abuse them. I have literally got items from them and it is really awesome. It is at my drop now, i will post a sneak preview once i get my hands on them.

For information, it is a product ranging from 100$ - 100$ ++, i believe it is rather feasible.
Let's make this nice and have everyone participate to get the forum active!
Wont everyone want to solve the mystery together and SE them?
Let's start - Good luck!

CODE - (Note that each letter you found reveal one letter out of the company.

Note that 6 pointers mean the company name is of 6 letters > 1 word

1. OTTF  ? SSEN           Tip* - A pattern
2. Part of the face - ___ >      Tip* - 5 senses - 1 word pronouncation 
3.  (14+4+2012x0+3-3-2+9x0+12+9x48+3) / 3  + 0.7 = WORD > 4th position of word from the left.*Tip* Do the maths.

Guess the last 3 words. more than enough hints are given.

I will release one encrypted message each day!
And even post the at any point of time if there is participation.

Good luck!
