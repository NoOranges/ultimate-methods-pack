OK SO IF YOU WANT FREE GUM......then GTFO!
jk
so lets begin....

1) go to amazon.com and pick a gum you want. I choose five gum.
2) call 1-800-WRIGLEY
3) tell them gum is very stale, tasted like cardboard, barely tasteful, the gum was very hard.
4) they will say ok can you read UPC off of the BOX. simply scroll down the amazon website and you will see UPC written there.
For example: http://i25.lulzimg.com/d68cd9.png
5) they will ask for they number beneath the Bestby numbers or the exp date say its scratched off.
6) Tell them that you bought in bulk so they will give you 3-5 coupons depending on how many gum you say you bought because their coupons are worth $3.50 so say you bought $15 worth of gum they will give you 4 coupons.
7) You still reading? 
9) Did you knew I missed 8? YOU SO DUMB :P
10) you still reading? GET A LIFE :P

BTW this tutorial was inspired by our member named "Dax" he said he wanted some gum but he was too dumb to try it him self :D

Sorry I didnt posted it in the tier 1 section, I didnt wanted this to get raped by leechers :P
