Lets get down to business


 Pick a product from StarTech (go look on newegg)
Head on over to the contact page http://www.startech.com/ContactUs and choose your contact method (phone,letter,livechat or smoke signal)
Tech support will walk you thru bullshit such as "HURF A DURF DID YOU PLUG IT IN?" (obviously it didnt work)
They will say please create an RMA (https://www.startech.com/RMAForm)
Go create a RMA request with the following data :Product ID (look on StarTech.com), Qty (Can you say bulk method),Reason (same thing you said to livechat),Date of purchase (Be reasonable ), Invoice (Leave blank) and Action (Choose cross shipping)


"BUT DARKRED WHY DO I CHOOSE CROSS SHIPPING?" - well smart one this means they ship you one as soon as you have "Shipped yours"
     
     6. Get your cross shipping ready. This means you can either box them,tell them they shipped it or generate a fake receipt for it
     7. Wait a bit

Enjoy free stuff
