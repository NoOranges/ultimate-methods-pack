Product name : pick any lock which comes with key I did it with OnGuard Beast 5017 Bicycle Chain Lock which costs 109$ on amazon.

EXCUSE: tell them you locked your BIKE/HOME with your lock and now key wont fit in.i am not expert in mechanism but i think something is broken inside.i faced lot of problems because my bike/home was locked with that lock when this happened. you have to call your mechanic and spent around 70$ just to get rid of the lock.you can add that paint of your bike or handle of your door was damaged during this. just be practical and creative. and you will get this mail in 2-3 days.
