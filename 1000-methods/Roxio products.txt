Don't mistake these for Elgato game capture devices. These aren't Elgato's, the company that was raped within 48 hours. 

Also if you submitted a reply by following the 3rd link I had then your case wasn't submitted. It was submitted for me for some weird reason. So if you followed my link to to submit a care go re-submit your case.

This has specifically been tested for their game captures, but it should work for most of their products like the video recorder, etc..

Here are Roxio's game capture devices: https://www.roxio.com/enu/products/game-capture/hd-pro/overview.html?rTrack=m_pro_gaming

This was done and worked like a charm before people got into se-ing "Elgato", and still works far more than trying to SE an "Elgato" game capture device. I personally haven't done them recently, but it still works

Now since its 3AM in the morning, which is why I am sort of posting this (I have nothing else to do cause a niq ran out of weed), so I thought I'd share one my older tuts with VIP's as I haven't shared anything in this section for a while.

Required Material 

Receipt - You will need to provide a receipt before they send you a replacement. I recommend staying away from Amazon receipts as most companies verify those. For small companies like this they usually only accept Best Buy, Walmart, etc. (basically regular stores, no resellers) receipts. 

Serial (maybe) - I honestly can't remember if you needed a serial, but you do need a receipt. I know I got a serial just incase, but can't remember if I ever needed to provide one. So just grab a serial for backup, I did, but I think I never used it. 

Now to the following 

1. Head here - LINK REMOVED (head to their support section) - click on 'Contact technical support', and create an account (a must to email them). 

After creating an account you will be brought to a page containing some information. I never needed this, but write down your pin as apparently you now need it to get support. 

Then click on 'View support options'.

2. You will be brought to a new page. On this page select the product you want support for, and the version(model). Then click on 'submit a question'. 

3. On the following page write the subject (Dead ass shit mayne?), then write down your issue (your shit bogus man?), the topic (general?), and your operating system (the best of best - OS X?). 

Then just submit your question. 

4. Wait on reply. If I remember correctly they usually responds fast. 

5. Depending on the rep you will get one of the following replies - 1, Provide receipt so we can process a replacement, 2, Sorry to hear you that, can you try the following steps?

If you get the type of reply in the 1st option then just provide the receipt, and then after they view it (verify it) they will ask for your address, give it to them, and receive your replacement. 

If you get a reply similar to the 2nd reply then just wait a few hours, reply saying "the steps didn't work", until they ask you for your receipt so that they can process a replacement. 

6. Keep 'cause you can't profit from these mofos, unless you get 10+. 
______________________________________________

Here is a number you can alternatively call - 1.877.582.6735. It's their sales number, but they should be able to transfer you to a support department (if they even have one). 

I know I didn't really give detail for detail on what to say in a responds, or the issue. You are VIP's you should have some experience on what to say. So basically I am just letting you know Roxio is SE-able. 

I just laid out the basics - email them, complain, provide pop, receive replacement. 

Enjoy ladies!
