Introduction
This is a short and simple method. I'm rushing this since I want to get back to SE'ing or I'll run out of methods! If this works better in the United States, good for you! UK Staedtler is very persistent in staying with company policies.


Method
1. Contact Staedtler with your fault during a festive time (Christmas) before their email signature states the time when their office closes for holiday.
2. Exchange emails and say you noticed that their office will be closed for the festive season (Christmas). Ask them if you can receive the replacement in advance before sending your pen/stationery out because you have holiday homework and all that.
3. Receive an advanced replacement.


Conclusion
Generally, you can test this out with your country's office and ask them whether you can have an advanced replacement without it having to be a holiday. If it fails, you can go with the method above. I tend to think of this method as a last minute method, since you can always shipping claim their goods. The only scenario where you wouldn't have the money to shipping claim is for one of their €100 pens.
