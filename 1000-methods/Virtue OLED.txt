Well Ive been on here for awhile and was looking for something to give back and I think I found it. I remember seeing a paintball gun thread awhile back by RandomScrubz and if you are like me and you SE'd a high end gun that has a board that controls the rate of fire and what not then this may be for you. This is a serious upgrade for any electronic paintball gun.

1. Go to the Virtue paintball website and pick out brand of marker you have. (in my case it was the invert mini)
Virtuepaintball.com

2. go to their contact page and copy the email address and shoot em an email with you excuse. Mine was that only the LED screen was in the anti-static bag. No main board. Also the cover plate was broken. 

3. A support agent will contact you (its always the same guy) his name is randy. He will tell you that it will get taken care of and and ask you for your shipping info. (no drop is required)

4.If he asks for pictures or anything make up a reason why you cant send them...Your all very smart so you can figure that part out!

5.He may ask for a POP...again your smart so you can come up with this real easy with photoshop. Not sure if an amazon receipt will work so please do not ask!!!! But make sure your POP is from some kind of sporting goods store.

6. He will say that it may have been a mistake on their part or at the store but he will get a new one out to you in the mail.

7.Install and enjoy the upgrade!!!

Sorry if this isnt the greatest written tut ever, it is my first try at a method and I wanted to give back!
