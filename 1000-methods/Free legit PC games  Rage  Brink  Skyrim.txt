First go here: https://insiders.bethsoft.com/register.php then grab a paystub from a friend who works at gamestop/wallmart/best buy or from google and edit it to your details. If you're not from US just input some random dude's address and info and be sure it matches the info on the paystub. Fill in the rest of the info and click accept and next. Done.

Took me 5 hours for my account to activate but when it did, I already had $200 worth of free games from Bethesda! I guess it's a way to make up for their shit pay? xD Enjoy guys!
