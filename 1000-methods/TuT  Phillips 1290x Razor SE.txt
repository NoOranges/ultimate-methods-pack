1290x serial number (starts with 5) 510385*** (dont quote me on it. i'm not sure if it's the last 3 digits.)

I have seen many people require PoP for phillips. That is certainly not needed. You can get the head and charger send to you without anything.
I'm not going to spoonfeed much, it's pretty self explanatory. Here goes.

1. Start a Live chat with phillips for the 1290x. Say the razor charges but it does not work. They should ask you a couple of questions.

Q: How many buttons does your razor have?
A: 1 for turning it on

Q: Does the razor charge?
Yes and it turns on however the razor does nothing

Q: What is the model number and serial number of the product?
Model Number 1290x
Serial Number (starts with 5, get one from ebay.

Stuff like that, answer as if you actually had the product.

2. They should ask you for an address email and phone to ship the head only to. Give that info.

3. Once you give them that info, beg them into giving you the charger as well. Say things like what if it's the charger etc.

4. If all goes well you should have a package with the whole razor package. If you only get them to send you the head etc, chat them again and say the razor still doesn't work.

I have gotten a razor through this method, enjoy.
