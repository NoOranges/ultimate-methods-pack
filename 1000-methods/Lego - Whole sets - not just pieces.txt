In this community it is known you can just grab parts from lego.com's replacement service for free. Now that gives you a maximum of 20 parts? I believe? 

Anyway, just saying, this is a method I occasionally use because it does cost money to use but the profit is pretty good. This is for them younger members that are still Lego users. I am one of them. 

Anyway, there is a site called Pleygo. It's deemed the netflix of lego. They have some sets but not all of them. 

They have 3 levels of membership, and this is why you have to pay for this method. 

There is a starter level for 15$, then a intermediate for 25, then a master plan for 39. 

What I do is grab a Visa Gift Card from the store, dump 40 bucks on it, and purchase the master plan. 

Then you can pick anything you want from the rentals and then well...you know what happens. Same thing with gamefly. Don't return it and if you think that you can pull off a double dip or so on, go ahead. 

Okay it may not be the best contribution but right now this is all I got...I'm not so involved with SEing now anymore as school is starting in 2 weeks and I can't do much anymore without my parents noticing I get way too much technology.
