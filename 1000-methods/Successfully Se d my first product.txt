Alright, so using astroPID, I attempted to SE a Logitech S-220 sound system, with after my 10 previous attempts at SE'ing all ending up needing to be sent in or proof of purchase required, I was not hopeful. Well I just received an email today saying that they will be sending me my new sound system! :D I am soooo excited! :D
