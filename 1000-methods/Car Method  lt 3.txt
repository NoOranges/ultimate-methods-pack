Hey Guys its Christmas time and I am releasing this guide because its the most worthful i have to share at the moment. I will hunt you down if you release it anywhere else. I will dox you and release it everywhere. Just for you to know :)

Methode:

Well the car I SE'd was standing outside of my house for atleast 10-15 years!
I have tried to figure out what the biggest thing you can SE is. I looked out of the window and i have seen this car. No one used it. No one cared about it. The owners were probably living in my house before i did. Well i have called the police to ask for the original owner of the car and they have told me to wait 20 minutes untill they arrive and give me some support. Allright they arrived and they have asked why I am asking. I am very good in making fast excuses and I have told them that its staying on my ground and I want to build something on the ground where the car is staying atm. They have checked some things and they came back to me. They have told me to keep the car and I couldnt be happier! I have asked them to write it on a paper and they did. The key part is that not even 1% of you has an old car standing outside of their houses etc. The cool thing is that they didnt even check ANYTHING about me and by law they need to give you the car if its on your "ground" and its not registered. Those laws are valid in mostly all countries. Its also important to take a paper or something official from the police stating that you are allowed to keep the car so you dont get in any problems for opening the car or making new papers etc. It makes everything easier.
This is a Christmas Present for you and I hope you enjoy it.
I wish you all a merry christmas and if you have any further questions feel free to ask me!
