Make an order.

Use shoprunner for free shipping(if you have shoprunner lol). If they don't usually leave packages at your door, sign for it with a DIFFERENT NAME.

Tell them you never received the package and if they ask who is the person that signed for it, they will probably say the persons name, say you have no idea, you live alone.....

They will ask if you want them to resend the order, tell them no, you are just going to buy whatever you need in person because you can't wait for another package to arrive, they might insist saying we can send it overnight, say no, you need whatever for tonight and you would like a refund, they will refund you on the spot.

I did twice so far at my house and my friends house, it worked flawlessly both times, they refund immediately if you paid with paypal.
