Required: Ciroc Bottle

Contact them on the website and say that your bottle tasted like dirty water, they will email you their number and tell you to contact them.

Call them via skype, they will ask you where you got it, say at this local liquor store and give them the address of a local liquor store, they will then ask for your information and the numbers on the bottom on the bottle for quality control purposes, give them everything and they will either send you a bottle to replace it or a check, I recommend finding the 1.75 liter bottle and write down the information before proceeded with this SE for best results!
