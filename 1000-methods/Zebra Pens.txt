Simple method but I don't want it to get raped. In my experience, Zebra will send you 12x the amount affected in the complaint, so no need to go overboard.

Just send them an email saying that the pen jams, or the mechanical pencil wont hold the lead or anything that could be wrong with one of their products. They don't require any pictures or POP or anything like that. You can see one of my SE's here. Hope you enjoyed, and thanks for reading!
