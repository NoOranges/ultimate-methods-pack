Ok, so alot of people seem to be afraid of doing call in's for some reason.

Here are some things that i noticed not many members seem to know.

Tips for Skype
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. YOU DONT NEED SKYPE CREDIT FOR 1-800 numbers or 877 or any 18xx, most companies use these, so go ahead and use skype all you want.

2.If you need help building confidence with a mic and calling using skype PRANK CALL.

Use the following number : 1-800-246-4411

That is bing 411, use it to connect to walmart,gamestop, whatever, and go ahead and do whatever.

SE tips
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


1. Have all your information ,pid,serial whatever the company uses what the item looks like and have some excuse ready. Reffer to number 6 if you dont have a pid or serial.

2. When doing call in's make sure you act nice, dont act smart, act stupid, address the person on the other line as "sir" or ma'am" make them feel important. After all they are going to be giving you free shit. Acting dumb is usually helpfull, remember these are people on the other line, so if you act stupid, they will eventually get fed up with you and just give in. In some cases this can be a battle of wills.

3. If your SE isnt going well, go ahead and ask to speak to a manger, when speaking with the manger complain about the rep, say he wasnt being fair he didnt treat you with the good service that you expect out of the company

4. If you are ever caught you can do one of two things, disconnect since you are using skype they wont bother lookin for you, or you could go ahead and rage the manger or rep, claim that they have the worst customer service ever, act like your outraged etc..

5. If the rep asks for your address before you mange to SE the item give them the correct address but fuck it up ex. 1290 Horse road, then when they confirm they will send it say, excuse me are you going to send it to me? They will say yes, ask them to repeat it and they will say 1290 Horse road, say oh, its 1920 Horse road im sorry. They will fix it, this way if you fuck up during the SE they will never have your correct address.

6. This is a little something i picked up on when i didnt have the serial number of a product, you can make companies send box's or even advances without serials if you do this. 

Talk to rep, tell them you dont have a serial it was peeled off, etc.. talk to this rep for a while, then when they keep insisting they cant do anything ask for the manger, when you are with the manger let him know you are recording the conversation, ask him if thats ok. They will usually say "yes", tell the manger that you cant believe how rude the previous operator was, go ahead and let him apologize, give him your story, or watever, he will say well company policy says blah blah, tell him you cant do anything you were promised warranty, and that you will be contacting the BBB, Better business bureau. They will usually give in, if not go ahead and try another day with a different manger. Just keep saying its urgenty and you want it dealt with, take charge you are their customer, and you have warranty, play your character well.
