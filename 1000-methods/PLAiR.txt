It's alternative to Roku I guess, or maybe even better solution. To be honest, I didn't try to SE Roku so I'm not sure.

Plair 2 is coming 8/11 (yes this is european format DD/MM)

When I contacted them, I did it for Plair 1
Anyway:
1. Website is http://home.plair.com/ or directly support@plair.com

2. Make some excuse (I said it's often disconnects by itself)

3. They will try with some troubleshooting steps (faulty power supply and stuff like that)

(When I did it, they were selling and shipping from amazon, so I didn't wanted to use astroproof, but luckily they didn't ask for receipt.)

4. After failed troubleshooting steps they will ask for stuff back.

5.  You will need another excuse for AR, so make a good one. Since my first one was with word often instead of always, they were willing to do AR.

Good luck.
