I've used this method only once.
It does work, but can be hit and miss.  Another person might get the job and this could conflict with your drops. even then find out the scheduled schedule for the person hired for the job.


Step one: Get your local paper.

Step 2: Seach for people needing house sitters/maintenance/people who need their bins taken out etc etc etc.

Step 3: Get the persons details.

Step 4: Ask what dates they will be away from.

Step 5: Say you can't do it for whatever reason.

Step 6: Voila, get your shit sent there within the timeframe the selected individual(s) are away.


ORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR

Do all the steps above and actually take the job on.  You may make some extra cash and a pretty sweet drop.


Tips: Note for the delivery to be put somewhere specific (Right side of the house etc) to keep it out of the line of vision incase someone does go to the house.

Cheeky stuff:- Psychologically speaking, if someone is hired for the job chances are they are going to do the job quickly and to a poor standard, as there is noone looking over their shoulder and checking the standard of their work.  This results in a larger timeframe for you to do your shit.


This is risky, but does work.

Don't be a majour fuckwit and take the job on and then not do the required tasks.
