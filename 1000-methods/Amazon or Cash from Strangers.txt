First of all let me start off by giving you the first rule with this thing. 

Rule #1  Dont get greedy.

Lets continue.

Step 1: Go on craigslist and go the the personals. I find that it works best with strictly platonic or casual encounters, but you can do whichever.

Step 2: Get yourself a fake phone number. I use pinger and exchange numbers with someone on the site. Talk to them for a few hours to a day and set up a meet. Mention that you are underage at some point and that you didnt want to bring it up because you were afraid they would refuse. Some will just outright turn you down, but a good amount should accept to meet anyhow.

Step 3: Mention that you are contacting the police unless they make it worth your while to keep quiet.(Get a little creative with this and try to sound passive aggressive). Ask for a few hundred through AGC or tell them to leave you a drop somewhere around the city.

Step 4: Either sell AGC or apply to your account. I personally sell the AGC on ebay as I dont like any possible ties to the money, but that is just me. If you receive cash then you're pretty much set.

Bonus: There are different variations that you could do with this. You could eventually find the persons full name and try to DOX them, but that just takes extra time that I find isnt needed. It's something extra, but eh.

Possible drops locations to use:
Apartment complex parking lots. (small parking roof caves)
Behind big dumpsters with small amount of activity
Side of small businesses. Places that generally close early and stay clear of much activity after dark.

You basically just want to be a good distance away while they place your cash and see them drive away. Go to the spot pick it up and drive away. I find that using a bike is the best way. You can hide easier and pick up and dash. This also allows you to take smaller routes in case of emergency where you might end up being followed.(Never happened to me, but you never know).

Be careful and good luck.
