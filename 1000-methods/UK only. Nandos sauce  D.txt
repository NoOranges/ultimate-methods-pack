As we can all agree this shit taste amazing! 
but at the same time its fucking expensive. 15pounds for 1L I think not!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


two ways to contact them either go to there website or the makers direct:

nandos:  http://anonym.to/?http://www.nandos.co.uk/contact/somethings-not-quite-right

manufacturer: http://anonym.to/?http://www.allaboutfoodltd.com/contact-us 

complain:

try and keep it very general; to mild (do not say to spicy!!!), watery, clumpy. not the same taste as previous bottles. 

they will email back asking for the batch details printed on the side of the bottle, and supply that with your details and get some coupons in the mail.
