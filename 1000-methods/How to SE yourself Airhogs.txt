First off you want to buy yourself a Airhogs(I tested this method with a helicopter)
Now what you want to do is call in Airhogs and tell them your helicopter does not fly straight and just circles around. You have searched up every method and it does not work.
They are going to ask you for the serial UNDER the remote. Give that to them and they will ask you for a picture of the Helicopter wing cut in half and the owners manuel.
Now what you want to do is become hand with photoshop and take a picture of the whole helicopter against a white paper. Now take the helicopter photo into photoshop and use the pen tool and take atleast half of the wing. Now take a picture of the owners manuel and now photoshop the wing onto the paper and make the lighting look realistic. Now the photoshop is done
Now they are going to want you to email it with the case number I believe.
They will now email you saying that everything is approved and now they will ship the product
You can also shipping claim the item so that you can double your money and sell it on ebay or ask for a store credit from target or walmart


First method in the Contributor section and I hope you enjoyed it :D
