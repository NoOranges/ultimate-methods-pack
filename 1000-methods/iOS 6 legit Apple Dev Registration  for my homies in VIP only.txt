Okay so...I'm not going to baby you through it...if you aren't that tech savvy (I assume we all are here right?) I take no responsibility for you fucking up your iPhone (I can help you out should it happen but you get what I'm saying right?...) 

So...

I can register people with Apple Developer Program legitimately.

Some places charge you a few quid to do it but I am willing to help my community out.
If you want in...

-I would appreciate a good method if you have one
-If you have no methods...tell me why you want it (be creative)
-If you aren't creative...just tell me a joke or something!

I have limited slots so make me want to give it to you!

Then...when you have done that...PM me your UDID. You can figure out how you get this. I will not be held responsible for mistyping or errors on this...its important I can copy and paste it so as to make sure it is exactly as you type it!

I will let you know If you are registered and that you can go ahead and install.

Peace out bruddas!
