Ive been asked by current parties for my method I used (http://astropid.com/forums/showthread.php?28755-xX-300-Item-420-MLG-SMOKE-ITXx-xxx360-NO-BOXxxx)

1. Find sandpaper company
2. Find product they have
3. Send them an email about how your sand paper was the not advertised grain (my 500 grain was actually 50 grain!) and caused you to damage your gotye you were sanding.
4. Tell them you demand a replacement for said sandpaper
4A OPTIONAL. Work it a bit more to get a check for your damaged  gotye
5. Receive sand paper
6. Sand wood

No I wont post the 3 email company. They are small and make great products so Im only hitting them once

Ill post pictures of the big ass box of sand paper once I pick it up from my other house.
