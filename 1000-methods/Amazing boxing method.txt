You can conquer boxed SE's fast if your box opens up while being delivered or in transit but it must at least make it to be weighed first so weight is still required.

Beat up your box, add something like sugar for weight or anything you like.

Tape the box with brown tape and slice it open with a knife and make sure you can open it easily, and i mean open it, don't leave any piece of tape that holds it sealed. 

Reseal it again with blue painters tape from Home Depot, this thing does not stick for very long. The box will open in transit and won't be delivered. 

Drop it off at a authorized ship center not Fedex or UPS, the official carriers won't allow blue tape. I usually drop off my packages at post net.

Call the company you're SEing in a couple of days, and ask what the hell is going on, they will refer to your tracking number and call your carrier. The carrier will say the package is open etc..... and whatever was inside is gone.

Good game.
