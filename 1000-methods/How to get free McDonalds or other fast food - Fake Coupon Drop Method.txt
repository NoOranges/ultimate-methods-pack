This is a new method I figured out today (tested tonight, it worked):

McDonalds just had Monopoly in the States.

Tomorrow is the last day you can use the coupons you get from it.

Steps:

Go through the drive thru.

Tell them you want either a breakfast sandwhich (for breakfast), a Medium Fries, or a Quarter Pounder. I believe those are the only 3 coupons they gave out this time but I am not sure.

Tell them you have a coupon for it.

Drive up and they might ask for money anyway. Tell them you have a coupon. Reach out your hand and drop a fake paper that resembles the coupon (a small square, black on the back), but make it believable. They should let you have a free item anyway as they will not tell you to go get it. (Make a fuss if they do.)

The employee might get the manager who will give you your item.

The only way this wont work is if they see it is fake. Tips to prevent this:

Use a real coupon with a fake one. Procrastinators out there will be using up your coupons anyway. Last day. :) Put the fake one under the real one and drop it by moving your fingers, etc.

Go when they are busy.

When you drive up have your hand out and drop it before she or he has a chance to look at it.



This might work at other times with a regular coupon fake, but the cardboardish colored coupons will be harder to fake. Maybe if they are distracted.

Might work at other fast food chains. If you are a true SEer, you wouldn't care. If they see it is fake, just drive off, they wont charge you. Or have a real coupon waiting and say that must have been something else.

This will also work with expired coupons and coupons that look alike. (Like dropping Burger King buy one get one free fries for a Burger King buy one get one free burger or a Wendy's BOGO meal.)

Enjoy!
