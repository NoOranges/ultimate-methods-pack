Here's another simple advance replacement or cross shipping. 

With this company you can get grills, toasters, coffee makers, juicers, and so many more shitsnezzz. Now I think this may only work with products that have the power plug built into them, I can't say it will work for cordless devices. This is also the same company I was/am getting shit for that service I am offering.

Anyways lets get started... 
What you will need

Date stamp (not necessary) - This will really depend on your story. It's needed, but you don't need it. 

Cross shipping (optional) - You can ship an empty box, provide tracking, and you know the drill. It doesn't cost more than $6 to ship. $6 for a $100-$200 product seems okay to me. 
Now lets get started

1. Head over to http://www.georgeforemancooking.com and pick a product you want. Like I said I am not sure about cordless shit, but I am assuming there process is similar if not better. 

You can pick any product from the site. Even from Russell Hobbs, FARBERWARE, Black & Decker, etc., it doesn't matter. They are all ran by the same company/support team. 

I personally went with a GF Grill for that "healthy" cooking. 

2. Call them @ 800-231-9786. I suggest calling, it only takes 15 minutes. Once you call get to the department you want. For me it was (dial 2) 'home appliances' (or something like that). 

3. Once you are speaking to someone, just work your charm because most of the time it be the bitches picking up. Anyways just go through the usual BS about how your product doesn't power on, you've tried this and that, etc. until she finally tell you that it will have to be replace. 

From there she will ask for your address, name, etc. (all the goodies).

*THEY DONT GIVE YOU REPLACEMENT OPTIONS FIRST. THEY JUST TELL YOU TO CUT THE POWER PLUG, SEND THAT IN. YOU HAVE TO ASK FOR ANY FASTER OPTIONS... THEN THEY WILL GIVE YOU SOME MORE OPTIONS*

(1)You will receive your replacement, or (2) you need to cut the end of the cord, and send it in for a replacement.

Once you are done with the call make sure to *grab your case/reference/id number*. 

4. If you get advance replacement (less than likely for wired products) just enjoy your replacement. 
4.1. If you get cross shipping just head to USPS, ship an empty box with the cheapest/slowest delivery options, which is about $5-$6/5-7 days, get tracking, call them back, provide tracking, get your order sent, and then receive your order.

_______________________________________________________________

Just a simple company/method. Nothing fancy. Same old "my shit broke, give me replacement". 

Also you don't have to ship anything in the box/envelope, but I did. I cut the end of a plug I didn't use anymore and shipped it to them just for kicks. 

*Oh also I almost forgot. You can avoid providing the date stamp/code that is located on the product by giving them good story ahead of time or when they ask you for it. I was asked "Are you in front of the device right now?" But right before she asked me that she had mentioned something while talking, she said "wait a sec while I write up your order/case... I might have you give me a code located on the device here in a bit too". So when she asked me if I was in front of it I knew if I said "yes" she would ask me for the code. So I just said "No, I am not in front of the device right now. I am actually at my neighbors house using there phone to call in as my line is dead". She just said ok, and wrote my case up. 

TL;DR: Give them a nice story as to why you aren't in front of the device so you don't have to provide the date code.*
