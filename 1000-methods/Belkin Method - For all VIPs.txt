Hi Guys,

I like to give something back to the community.
I'm here since the forum started - like first day member.
I already donated some money to the forums.
Now I want to give out my methode to you.

It is really easy for Belkin. You can request an advanced replacement directly Online:
http://www.belkin.com/support/

Search for a product you like on : ww.belkin.com or search on amazon.com for the product number
Then go to: http://www.belkin.com/support/
Enter your adress, product number etc. also enter where you bought it.
Then you go ahead with advanced replacement or box method... you can send in an empty box.

Done it now for two items without any problems :)

Enjoy
