So it's something like thumbsUp UK with small, cheap and handy gadgets/toys.

Unfortunately, I was on live chat (you will see the button on top of the site) and the window is small and can't be resized so I couldn't take a screenshot and later I forgot to copy/paste.

Anyway I SE'd Samurai Umbrella from this link http://www.kikkerland.com/products/umbrella-samurai/ but you can try any other item probably.

Also be careful, I contacted them two times because they didn't agree to send item to my country, so after second time I spoke with some rep (can't remember name) I said to him that I spoke to rep named Avi and he answered something like "Yes, he is here, right next to me". So I guess there are 2 of them in support.


I did them in Friday so wait a little bit and try.
