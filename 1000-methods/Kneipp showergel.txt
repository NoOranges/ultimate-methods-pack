Hello guys,

since astroPID went down I tried some new things.

http://www.kneipp.com (it redirect to your country automatically, if not you can click on a country)
search for a contact form.

My message was:
Dear,

Since I am a huge loyal user of your products, I wanted to let you know that my last experience with it wasn't that great. I tried the Kneipp shower gel Mint & Eucalyptus and after the shower my skin became very itchy and red. So I wanted to inform you guys about this problem.


They sent me one email back if I was okay now and if I was combining this product with an other lotion. 
I replied that my skin became normal again and that the itchy feeling was gone.

After my reply they asked for my address.

And they have sent me some of their newest shower-cremes.
