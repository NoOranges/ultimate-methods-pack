(Not quite a method but more of a trick)

This one works not only for electronics but many other things aswell.


Simply have an item that is out of warranty but you want to exchange for a new one. (Game controllers for example)

1. Go to Wal-Mart

2. Buy the item you want replaced.

3. Open the back nicely,this isn't Christmas morning.

4. Take the new one out,replace it with the old one.

5. Return for money back.



I do this quite often with ps3 controllers with only six-axis to get one with six-axis and dualshock.




Like always,I'll have another method soon!
