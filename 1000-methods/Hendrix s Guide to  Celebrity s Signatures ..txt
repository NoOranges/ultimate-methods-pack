I recently managed to obtain some popular celebrities signatures. Some of these signatures are highly valuable to collectors and I managed to sell them for a fair bit on eBay.

There's a site called fanmail.biz which has a database of tons of celebrities addresses that other members of the site have used to successfully obtain a signature from their chosen celebrity.

Simply lookup the celebrity in the database, i.e Justin Bieber and get the address that people have had success with in the past. Now, you're going to want to persuade the manager (who is usually the one who receives the letters, and then forwards them on to the celebrity at their discretion) to pass the letter to the celebrity. This is where your social engineering skills come into play.

I usually write a short but meaningful sob-story about how my daughter has only a few weeks left to live and really wants a signature from her favourite celebrity. One thing that helps is if you can find a picture with your chosen celebrity with a girl fan. You can then attach that picture to the letter and say "You've actually met my daughter before, here's a picture of you two." Which will usually be the final straw to persuade the manager to forward your letter to the celebrity. 

If the celebrity is very busy, you may be given a pre-signed photo of the celebrity which is still pretty much the same thing. Some celebrities will personally write you a response if they are not too busy. I recommend writing tons of letters and send them all of at once (just change the celebrities name, of course) and you're bound to get a lot of signatures in return which you can then sell on for a decent profit on ad-sites such as eBay. Alternatively, you can get your favourite celebrities signature for yourself, or get your wife / mother / sister their favourite celebrities signature as a gift.
