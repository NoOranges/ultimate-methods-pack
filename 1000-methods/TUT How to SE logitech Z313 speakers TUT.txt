First off ring this number: 0800 085 74 99 (UK Free Number, If you are USA, find the number on the Logitech website).


Then press "2" on your keypad and you should be talking with a representitive.


Make out you recieved it as a gift, then tell them the following.


Tell them something like the following:
"No sound is coming out of the Speakers"
"Its plugged in correctly but the power isn't working at all"
"Can you help me Troubleshoot?" (Then make out its broken)


Basically just make sure they realize it is broken.
They should offer you a replacement, in which case provide your address and everything that they need to ship it to.


IF THEY ASK FOR PID NUMBERS ETC!
Use the ones in the "Information"

Remember to use a rubber before you rape this bitch!
