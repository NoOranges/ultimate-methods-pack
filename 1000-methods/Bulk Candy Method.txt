I have decided to write my tutorial on obtaining bulk candy like this: http://imgur.com/zljrmLT

This is really simple, it's just another way of contacting a company rather than complaining about their product. Me personally, when I want something like this in bulk I will always ask for donations. Make a story sound very believable, if you want a lot of something, don't forget to mention that the candy is needed for a large event.

This is what I said:

And you will receive something like this:

If you're wondering what company this was, it was Toxic Waste. Enjoy raping. I've already received my candy from them, and I'm getting more from them very soon.
