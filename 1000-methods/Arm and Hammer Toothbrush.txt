Hello
I recently purchased Arm & Hammer Spinbrush Toothbrush, Rechargeable, Pro Clean Sonic Recharge.
When I brought it home I used it before bed to test it out. I went to charge it I didn't see any lights
turn on and I let it charge for 25 minutes and tried it out, It still didn't work. 
So I thought it would take longer so I left it for the night.. When I got home the next morning before 
work I tried it again. It still did not work.. I tried a different plug and it still doesn't work. 
So I tested it on my friends charger who uses this toothbrush also It still did not work. It was very 
disappointing  seeing I always use your products and this never happens.

They sent me a coupon replacement that my mom threw away before i even saw it lol.
