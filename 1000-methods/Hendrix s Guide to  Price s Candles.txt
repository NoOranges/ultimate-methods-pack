Price's Candles is probably the easiest candle company I've ever done. They don't require anything, with the exception of an email account to communicate with them.

They stock 'luxury' candles, which aren't too expensive unlike more reputable luxury brands but they are quite nice. They offer complimentary products (plural) as a gesture of goodwill for the inconvenience you have experienced *wink wink*.

First off, head over to their website (prices-candles) and find the product that you specifically want, make sure it's something that you can complain about. Once you've done that, head over to 'Contact Us' and draft a new email to them. 

Start off by telling them the product in question and who you bought it for (I usually say I bought it for my wife), and then compliment their brand. This will get them on your side and the representative will want to help you and risk losing a loyal customer.

Next, tell them the problem. Be creative. What can go wrong with candles? The wick can have difficulty burning etc. My standard excuse is that the candle has an 'unpleasant' aroma which is not up to the fragrance's usual standards, as you have had this same fragrance in the past.

Finally, just add a bit of story around your complain to make them have sympathy for you, i.e the candle was meant for a romantic dinner, and the aroma that spread around the room ruined the evening.

Within a few business days, you should receive a reply directly from a customer care representative apologising, and offering you some complimentary gifts and a replacement candle as a gesture of goodwill. Simply give them your postal address and you're done!
