This is a small company, with great reviews for there no fans, no wires Solar Notebook Cooler. I personally love mine, and use it everyday without having to have all the fancy LED lights and USB connections to run it. It basically takes the heat from your Laptop, converts it and cools.

Just to remind you that all my Guides have never been used, or gotten from anyone else. Therefor there should be no problems. I find my own company's because that's what carves out the most success. I like this forum, so I will share to people who know what to do with the information.

This method will only be PM'd to certain people (YOU MUST POST ON THE TOPIC FIRST) who I think will use it wisely. Companys that are bigger I would tell everyone, but I think for this one it's probably a good idea.



Key notes to email them with.

1. Always say you have used there products before.
2. Say your family has two others that work fine.
3. Theres NO WAY you can send it back. (HAZARD).




I will respond within the day to about 10ish people, so just be patient and enjoy.
