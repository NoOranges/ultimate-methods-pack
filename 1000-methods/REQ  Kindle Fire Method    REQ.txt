Alright, so I have a EntroPay VCC, and a parcel-forwarding address. I think my last account got banned because whenever I reset my pass it still says that it is still a wrong password. I would prefer it if I could just use my regular address, and I'm not comfortable with Mail-Fraud, all I can reward who ever helps me is with a Minecraft Premium Account. This is pretty much why I bought AstroPID.
