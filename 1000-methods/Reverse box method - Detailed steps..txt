Hi there, sorry everyone for not making a method in a while!
I've seen a few people talk about this as a concept but i thought i would make a nice detailed guide which works on pretty much any company.
This method is a good way to get higher price items from companies like Amazon etc who at time of writing have slowly started to crack down on shipping claims.

As for the boxing itself, it always looks better with an actual weight label.  Spoof the weight whichever way you choose.  Here is the link to my advanced dry ice method which fits this method down to a tee: http://astropid.com/forums/showthread.php?18484-Advanced-boxing-Dry-Ice

Step 1) Buy an item you want. - Does require an initial investment, this method is for people with money to spend and want to double their "investment".

Step 2) Receive the item.

Step 3) Setup a return as the item is faulty etc etc.

Step 4) Box them, if your going to spoof the weight make sure that the weight is on point.  (Many sites provide the weight of their item, apply that to the above).

Step 5) They will receive the box and be baffled.  (I strongly suggest you spoof the weight, if you do they can simply not refund/give you a replacement).

Step 6) Enjoy!
