This method isn't too hard, but I've already gotten 2 pairs of headphones, so I'm done with them, now I'm sharing with MagicPID!

Step 1: Find something you want from Sony, easiest things are items without serials or PIDs, like headphones.

Step 2: Call Sony and tell them that something is wrong with the headphones, but you are unable to ship them (You are a DJ and even though only 1 side works, you still need to use them). Be creative.

Step 3: Ask if they have advance replacement, they will say no, but you have to keep bugging them about it, and eventually they will make an offer for you and say they will e-mail you a shipping label and as soon as you ship out your headphones, you can call them and they will send out a new pair.

Step 4: Box meth the headphones, and call them up right after you ship "your headphones" and ask them to ship a new pair like they agreed to.

Step 5: Enjoy your headphones and completely ignore Sony or double your profits and tell them "Hey, I never received my headphones", and file a claim with them, and get priority overnight shipping on a second pair.

And by the way I SE'd these:
