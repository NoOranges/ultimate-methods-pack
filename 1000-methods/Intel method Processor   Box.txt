What you need:

A picture of the processor. (OUT of box) http://www.intel.com/support/feedback.htm?group=processor

Start up a chat and tell him the processor isn't working, he will ask you to give him 5 lines of info(That's what the picture is for) 

Send him the info and your address.

Use the box method, I will not post it here.
