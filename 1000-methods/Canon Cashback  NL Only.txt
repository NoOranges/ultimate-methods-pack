This one is a little bit trickier than the Philips cashback. You will see why in the steps below.
The profit is huge tho I have done 700 euros in total.

1. Go to: http://www.canon.nl/cashback/
2. Ýou'll see that they offer different values of cashbacks for different products. Choose the one you like or the one that is the easiest to find serials for.
3. Find the serial. Its located on the box.
4. Here comes the tricky part. The product has to be bought in The Netherlands. This means an Amazon receipt wont work. Dont try it anyway I have tried and can confirm that it doesnt work. You will have to photoshop a receipt.
5. You will get your cashback in 6 weeks max. (it took 1 week for me)


Public Service Announcement: I know a lot of guys will now ask me to photoshop a receipt for them as I have done in the past. I wont do it anymore. I'm very busy atm and to be honest its not that hard to learn. If you want to be a good SE'er you should learn how to make fake receipts with PS. It will help you in you SE's and it will only take 20min max to learn it. There are some great tutorials out there to learn this.
