Very simple method for awesome guitar/bass strings. Simply tell them something like how your strings broke easily such as you were tuning your guitar to C# standard (for heavier gauge strings) and a string snapped on you. This company is a really nice company who makes great strings (I think so at least) so if you do SE them and like their strings please potentially buy their strings in the future other than just SE'ing them. They shouldn't ask for receipts but if they do i'm not sure what works. Potentially Amazon or make a little home town music store receipt and it should suffice. 

This is basically the whole method.. Not sure how common it is with bass strings breaking but i'm sure you could get some if you come up with something other than just the strings snapping so be creative. Like i said earlier, very simple method but i don't want them getting tons of emails so i'm posting this in VIP. Enjoy the strings if you get some they're great.
