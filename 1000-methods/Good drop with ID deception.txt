1. Get package delivered to apartment building.
2. Scan your ID into photoshop and adjust the name to match the package name. (possible change address too)
3. Put the laser printed color id over your real one and stick it through the clear part of your wallet. 
4. put a shit ton of ducktape around your wallet. Ducktape, clear tape, and regular tape.
This way.. if the clerk asks you to take the ID  out of the slot, you can attempt to take off some of the tape, but then she'll be like fuck it, this is taking too long, here's your package.

WAT.
