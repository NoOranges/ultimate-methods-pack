&#8203;&#8203;Welcome!
Firstly , sorry for this plain and simple design, i dont think there's a need for a good design.


So, hi guys! Despite the fact of saturation, i believe that no one will use it for own cause (leeching) , thus , i decided to share my guide openly.
Be it new or experienced, i have confidence that my guide will be useful to many.

Not only having providing excuses or reasons, I have came up with a list of alternatives key words usable for physical, electronics,perishable (food) products and common issues that can be used for future social engineering with several useful words in phrasing your sentences.

Moving on to a whole new level, these strong words will bring out emotions to "liven" your story , making it seemingly believable and the end point ; the customer support accepts the story.

Be sure to use them up and spice up your story!
