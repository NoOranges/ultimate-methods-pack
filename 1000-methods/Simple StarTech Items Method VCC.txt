I found this a while back and i have been getting stuff from them but i thought i could post this. So here we are.

StarTech makes interesting items that are just... Well you will have to see what i mean. There is 0 risk in this at the moment, But as always play at your own risk.

What you need:

Receipt from Newegg or other seller (Use WESET)
VCC (at least $1)
Computer (or Smartphone)


Steps (X=Your Variable):

Pick a item (HERE or Any other store)
Go to StarTech's website HERE
Click the live support (HERE) *They may not be open, so try again later.
Tell them how you bought X amount of X item/s and they all work but X of them.
They will do the basic trouble-shooting
Say its still not working
They will have you make a RMA
You can select Advanced Replacement or Cross-Ship
Enter your VCC
Get the item in the mail (Took me 3 days to get my DPtoHDMI converter)


That is it! Now i am guessing that they don't have a large Tech Support team because they are a bit slow at responding to you, So don't do it a lot at once. Good Luck.
