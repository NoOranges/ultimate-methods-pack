easy little method, idk if it will work for everyone but i got it to work :).

step one- http://bombfootbags.com/TheBarrage.html 
go to the site and find a footbag you want.(i chose this one.)

step 2- go to contact and send an email saying something like 
"hey i bought one of youre footbags and i was playing with it with my friends, and dont get me wrong we treat it with care cause we dont want it to break but today while gently kicking it back and forth it ripped in mid air and actually got sand in my friends eye. is there anything you can do about this?"

you should get a 1 time replacement :)

goodluck!
