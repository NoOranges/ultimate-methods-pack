And here is another nice methode, which doesn't know many people out there.
You can get free things from Netgear for Beta Testing their things...
I got so far 2 Media Stations, 1 NAS, 1 Switch, 1 Router and 2 Powerline Connection Sets for LAN.

Just register here:
https://www.beta.netgear.com

They accept nearly anyone when they search for people in beta test. They also send the product world wide! You can keep the things after test. You jsut need to fill out an survey while testing...
I have been accepting in all beta tests I was applicating for...
