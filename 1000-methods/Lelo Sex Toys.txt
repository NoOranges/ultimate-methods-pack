Probably only works with Vibrators, depends on what you can come up with I guess..

Email them saying that your toy isn't turning on and it's not working at all.. 

If they ask for a receipt, you can use a generated one as they don't verify them. If they ask for a serial(card), say you threw away the card and find a product on youtube or something and take a picture of it as "Proof". When they ask for you to send it back, say you have AIDs niggas :).
