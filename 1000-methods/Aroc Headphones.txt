They might request pictures now - try to  bypass that by saying you don't have a camera, or had to get rid of the old headset for whatever reason.

1. First, email/call Aroc about your headgear. Their customer service is quite fast. Make up an excuse as to why it needs to be replaced (ex. part of the wire split allowing you to see the inner workings).   
2. Wait for a reply like this ~ "Please advise where you purchased the product and do you have your receipt?"
3. I used Best Buy - the first place to show up on Google search. Tell them that it was a gift of some sort and the original buyer is no longer around (vacation, death, etc). Be creative! 
4. Wait for a reply like this ~ "Dear ____, Please provide your address and I will send you a new headphone. What is the colour? Thanks"
5. Give them valid information to process the replacement. Since they don't expect the product back you can use a personal address.

Bonus Tip: Don't name a store if you can't get a receipt for it. I had a BB template ready, just in case this company was strict.
