1. Email GMCR about a box of K-Cups. Tell them a) they were crushed and would no longer fit in the holder or b) it tasted like hot water - if you shake the cup they hardly have any coffee in them.
2. Wait for a reply asking for these things: the Best By date (BUBD), a machine code (i.e. K282), a time stamp (i.e. 12:42), size of the K-Cup® pack box, and number of individual K-Cup® packs that are affected.
3. If you have actual boxes with you, send that information. This isn't like a phone that they can disable. Most of it can be made up if need be. 
4. GMCR will request your address and agree to send a replacement pack. 

Note: Naturals Hot Apple Cider cannot be shipped to Canada. This was tested in May - no issues.
