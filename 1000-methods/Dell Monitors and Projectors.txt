DELL BILLS IN THE UNITED STATES, THEY DON'T BILL IN AUSTRALIA CURRENTLY.

I don't know if this has been posted in the past but i checked and couldn't find anything.

I presume people already know this but for those who don't then dell advance replaces monitors and projectors. For the projectors i think they send without lamp.

All you need is a service tag under your name or a service tag which you know the name of the person. Give dell a ring or you can chat online if they have technical support online in your country and tell them a good excuse where they would have to replace.

Some examples:
1. Monitor/projector won't power on
2. Monitor screen is black and nothing is displayed (Don't use this excuse for projectors)
3. Think of one :D

This method really doesn't need to be detail since it is so simple. Also when the rep is troubleshooting, just act like you're really sitting at a damaged monitor/projector.

Please don't post childish comments, if you enjoyed the method and never knew out ok but if you did then don't bash on my thread about knowing it.
