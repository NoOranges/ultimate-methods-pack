some companies wont care if you lost your item. or they ship with fedex and make you sign for it and all. a simple solution is to say you got something else in the box rather than what your ordered

I.E: you ordered black ops 2 but you say that hitman was in the box.

or

you order a 40 inch tv but you say you got a 30 inch


BY LAW. they have to let you keep what you got and send you another one.
