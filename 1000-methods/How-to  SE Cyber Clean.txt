Cyber clean is a magnificent product that helps remove 99.9% of bacteria as well as thoroughly clean all of your household items! You can use it on keyboards, mice, phones, speakers, TV's etc... and it basically gets rid of all the dirt and dust that you cannot get out by yourself, it's an awesome product.

Hello, I recently bought a (weight) (product name) of Cyber Clean, I have bought this product many times before and I love it! But, I came to open up the tub and found that it was horrible! It had black bits dotted on it and it smelt awful - not like the usual lemon scent. I am highly disappointed with this and am not sure whether or not to buy this product again as it was just not as expected


Step 3:
You should receive an email within a few days, now they may or may not ask for a serial number. (If they ask for one tell me and I'll give you it)


Step 4:
They should ask for your delivery information, give them real info or drop info (It's a £5 cleaning product so...yeah)

Step 5:
You receive your brand new cyber clean :D
