I will teach you how I SE'd a basketball from Spalding.

You will need a picture of the ball and a PoP.

Call in the support line and tell them whats wrong with your ball (I said my ball wouldn't bounce right). They will ask you to email the pics. The next day call back and ask about the pictures. They will check 'em on the spot and say that they will send you a new ball in 5-10 days. I did this for a $90 basketball in Canada. It should be working, so get a ball before it's saturated.
