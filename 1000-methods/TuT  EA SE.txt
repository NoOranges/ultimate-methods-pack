Hey guys, this will probably be my last post in the VIP methods section. This is gonna be about SE'ing ea. Basically, you need:

Receipt
Edited manual... I will post some blank ones in the elite section once i get enough posts.
SE skills and EA account
CD key format (XXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXX etc)

1. Start a live chat with EA
2. Say your key dosent work. they will ask for the key.
3. They will say your key is invalid and will tell you to contact your store. Tell them you already did and they told you to contact EA.
4. They will probably ask for the game manual with cd key/receipt. Give that to them.
5. They will either give you a key or add it to your origin account.

Enjoy!
