Yesterday I went to watch a movie with my girlfriend at chadstone Cinema Hoysts. As we found our seats my girlfriend and I sat down and a few seconds later I felt my pants wet and stood up and noticed my chair was wet and sticky.. same thing happend to my girlfriends seat. I just came out from work and was wearing black formal pants which are very expensive. I was very upset and complained to the assistant, he was no help at all and just offered different seats in a bad position to the screen. I am very disappointed with the cleanliness, as well as ruining my pants. Has this happened to any other customers?
