Company offer some activity + sleep tracker (Whatever that means), and a scale. Nice small stuff. 

Anyways. Lets get into.... 
Requirements 

Receipt - A fake one from BestBuy worked great. 
Steps 

1. Go to http://www.fitbit.com/home - Look for a nice little product (out of all 3 they offer :P) that you would like to sell/keep. 

*Create a fibit account. Not really needed, but they recommend you make one when you are talking to a rep. So just make one ahead of time*. 

2. http://help.fitbit.com/customer/portal/emails/new - Pick your product, and issue (Hardware and acc. > X issue here). Fill your your name, email, etc., and leave a comment. 

3. Wait for reply. 

4. Reply, go back and forth until replacement is talked about and you are asked for your address, name, etc... 

The rep will eventually ask for your name, address, email to your fibit account (maybe), receipt, etc..You know what to do. 

*A BestBuy edited receipt worked great. If you make your own make sure the store sells their product(s). Most stores don't.*

5. Get replacement. Keep or sell this expensive ass item they gave you for free.

Nothing big, but I thought I'd post this here just incase anyone wants to weight their drugs too, needs a scale, tracker, etc.. I'll move it down on Thursday/Friday. 

Now check out my drugs (I promise the pic isn't from Google Images :P)
