Requirements

-iOS Device (iPhone, iTouch, iPad)

-Phone # (Google Voice if you don't have one)
-I believe this is US residents only. If not please quote me :)

1)Download the app Clover Pay from the App Store.

2)Verify your Phone Number, preferably by voice as I believe it is easier than verifying by text.

3)On your iDevice, visit https://www.clover.com/a?inv&t=2djf0ddh8g30 in Safari. (If it says something similar to this, than you need to find a different invite)

4)It should then take you back to the main Clover Pay App, and ask you a few more questions, such as your name, and to enter a PIN Number. (PIN can be anything like 1234)

5)After you enter your PIN, you'll be given $5 which can be immediately withdrawn to either a Bank Account, PayPal, or as a Amazon Giftcard. (Debit Card or CC is required to verify identity)
