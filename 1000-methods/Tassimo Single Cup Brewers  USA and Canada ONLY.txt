Hi there,

I recently saw a recall for this product, and as I don't live in USA or Canada, I want to share with you, my fellow USA and Canadians SEers friends ! 
I think that it cannot be saturated because nearly 2 million Tassimo coffeemakers are being recalled.

Nearly 2 million Tassimo coffeemakers are being recalled in North America according to the U.S Consumer Product Safety Commission and its Canadian counterpart, Health Canada. The Tassimo Single-Cup Brewers from BSH Home Appliances uses plastic disks, or T Discs, which can burst during brewing and spray hot water and coffee grounds or tea leaves onto consumers, posing a burn danger.

There have been 140 reports of cases where the Tassimo machines have burned consumers during the beverage brewing process. In 37 of the incidents, victims received second degree burns. And in one case, a 10-year old Minnesota girl had to be hospitalized after receiving second-degree burns on her face and neck.

So, here's the tut :

1. To quote the previous website: "This current recall involves Bosch and Tassimo Professional branded coffee brewers. BSH Home Appliances is recalling specifically". So you'll be able to get these models: http://d.pr/i/Kk3u

2. As mentioned on the website, choose one of the model you want.

3. Contact them ( www.tassimo.com )

4. On the contact form/email; say that you bought the brewer between June 2008 - February 2012. Just be creative to not to have to return "your" brewer. Here's two methods:
&#8226; Be creative and try to find a way that ended you up to throw out the brewer. (it burned you/your son/mother/etc)
&#8226; Do the box method.

5. SE done.

If they ask you for a serial number; Tas number and/or FD product code; simply go to your favourite local store and find the model you want to SE and look under the machine to have these infos.

I haven't tried it because I'm from France and this is only for USA and Canada, but it should work since it's a recall program.



Ps: English is not my native language, sorry for mistakes.
