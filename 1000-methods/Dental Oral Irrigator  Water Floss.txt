Battery/Charging Issue:
Hi, i was gifted one of these oral irrigator by my dentist who recommended me this pretty awesome product. But a couple days ago, i have face some sort of battery problem. I try charging it for 24 hours but it still give me the buzzing rumble when i try to turn it on. I also tried different outlet, and there is still no charge. Can i get some help. Thanks

2) They will ask for a shipping addressee, and the colors that you want (black is the best). They will send a replacement no question ask.
