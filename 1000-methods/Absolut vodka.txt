they will ask for what region you are located in.


Then you will get a reply like this in your email:
Many thanks for taking the time to advise us of your issue with a bottle of Absolut 70cl
 
 
To help me diagnose this issue  / share this with my brand owners could I ask for the following details please
 
·         Do you still have the bottles in question?  If so could you let me have the lot code (it looks something like L1234) and is found on the bottle or label itself
(This helps us to know when the product was born and if we have had similar type of issue with this birth date)
 
·         Could you let me know the size of the bottle and the name as it appears on the label -  as you can appreciate we have a series of variants & sizes and I would like to id which one you are using
 
 
·         Could you let me know if you still have the shop receipt.  Receipts sometimes carry vital clues about the product – if you have this it would make our investigations easier
 
·         If you could let me know the shop / area in which you purchased the goods from – this is just for our own records.  We will not contact the store. 
 
·         For our own records please could you supply your full postal address, including postal code
 




Don't give them any bottle details as they will want bottle plus lequid back, just give them a fake receipt they don't verify as they state in their email.

Then you will get like this:
Many thanks for this.  We will conduct our investigation over the next couple of days and write to you with our findings.
 
Going forward – if you experience an issue with any of our portfolio I would always urge you to keep the bottle & liquid.  This will allow us to collect and identify root cause.
 


But they don't they will overnight you coupons for the value on the receipt. 
so my receipt said £19.25 they sent me £20
they send it in £5's which can be combined so you can do it as £22.45 for a 1L bottle and get £25.
 



they have a tiny team of support so lets leave it here for a while.
more alcohol companies to be posted. ;)
