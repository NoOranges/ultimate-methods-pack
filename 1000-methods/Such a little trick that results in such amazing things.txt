So I go crazy with the Social part of SE, you'll rarely need a serial or a box for mid range toys if you can rock the social part really well.  People like people, people like people who they've shared intimate details with even more, that's called rapport and it makes all the difference.  My last call in with a lady rep lasted about ten minutes but by the end she'd told me about her brothers, her weight anxiety, her college days, the zits she used to get around her scalp, her hair color, and that's she thinks she can do better than her current boyfriend.  Plus AR of some 200$ toys that are supposedly difficult :D

It all started with the line "Damnit I was hoping for a guy rep, this is a really gross situation"  Another more generic could be "I was hoping for a guy rep, at my age I get nervous hearing pretty voices"

Right there they have to make up a excuse to put you at ease which is almost always a story about their brothers or uncles.  Or for the second they usually say "I could talk like this" in a gruff voice and then you both laugh and talk about what you picture she looks like based off her voice(be cocky funny).  That lets you talk about them as you build rapport which is all women ever really want to do.  That simple intro can be the difference between two week delivery and overnight shipping and even advanced replacement vs boxing it.

Because you got them to share personal details to make you feel at ease, they also feel at ease and will want to take better care of you.
