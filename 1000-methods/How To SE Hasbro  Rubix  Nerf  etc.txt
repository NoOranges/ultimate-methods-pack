Hey guys, here's a quick tutorial to SE'ing Hasbro. I know, none of us really need toys and shit but you can get free Nerf guns and Rubix Cubes. I got a Rubix Cube since I love brain games and such.

Hi, recently I bought my son a classic Rubik's Cube. He loves brain  twisters so he was excited to try and solve it. When we opened the  package, there was two green sides and no blue side. There's no point in  trying to solve it with two green sides and no blue so, I'm emailing  you guys to see if you can help me out. Thanks.

Pretty easy and straightforward email, right?
