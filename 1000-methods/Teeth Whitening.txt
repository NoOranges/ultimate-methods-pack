Hello, I am Prime and here is another SE tutorial. 
I mean... Who doesn't want whiter teeth, and before you ask NO this is not crest whitestips.


Step 1. You are going to go to this site here to find out what product you want. I went for the one hour white kit but you could probably gat anything. http://www.lusterpremiumwhite.com/

Step 2. After picking what you want do a little research, if it is the kit, think of some things that could go wrong. Some of the more experienced SE'rs may be able to skip this step but I will add anyway.

Step 3. Go here and email or call  them to preform the actual SE http://www.lusterpremiumwhite.com/contact-us/

Step 4. Say something along the lines of It was crust, light would not work from the kit and the kit was missing the mouthwash, the toothpaste was empty, there are so many things that can go wrong.

Step 5. You should receive an email in a few days and they will offer a replacement,  I have made AstroPID just a bit whiter :P

ENJOY
