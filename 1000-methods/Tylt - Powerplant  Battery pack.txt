1. Come up with a reason why the device has an issue.

2. They'll ask where you got it from, I said Amazon.

2a. They'll ask to tell Amazon to replace it, tell them Amazon denied you


3. They'll then ask for your address and receipt.

4. After basic troubleshooting they may or may not say "we will send you a replacement but we will need the defective unit back for testing purposes."

5. If they say they want it back, use generic excuse for advanced replacement.
6. They'll send it out, w/ out asking for a vcc
