I saw this comment one day while trolling some pc tech board and figured FREE CASE

"They said the HAF-X cases with problems are the one with Lot number range from
RC942KKN11103301208 to RC942KKN11103803120 
and that mine Lot number seem to be fine since is newer"

You need:

Serial (you any of the lot numbers above)
VCC or prepaid with $1 balance (To auth the card)
Receipt (amazon or newegg generator will work!)



So you can go into chat or call to do this, i prefer call, i have done this twice and another friend did this was amazing success.

You tell them your firewire killed your motherboard and you want a replacement case immediately seeing as you already got a new motherboard and your computer has been down for over a month due to this dilemma. They might tell you they don't want to replace the entire case and send you the panel. Tell them NO, you're not a PC technician and you don't want to hurt yourself. They will ask you to send the case in first, say oh no, this is going to take another month, do you offer advance replacement, they will say we can make an exception this time due to all the stress this has .... blah blah blah your case will be mailed to you asap.

Truth of the matter is, they take about 3 weeks to deliver the case to you which isn't asap but who cares.

This might work with any of there products, I have seen others get coolermaster items on this board.
