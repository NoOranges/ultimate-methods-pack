So Philips, bless it's trusting soul, sells a plethora of baby accoutrements from some of the best breast pumps to baby monitors to space age baby bottles.  This method is barebones but if you're a decent actor on the phone(or get the right rep in chat) it works wonders.

Find what you want under mother and child care.

-Call them up (1-800-542-8368) and if you don't want a challenge keep calling until you get a lady rep.  Tell her the product you got and a quick scary description of the problem(sharp nipple, leaky bottle, no audio etc) and how the baby's due in two days and you need all of this for your sweetums before the magic moment.
-Then get sidetracked together talking about your new baby(she'll have baby stories too, all women do) and how great said baby will be, ask her advice, bask together in that weird hormonal/exhausted paranty afterglow people get when babies are involved.  If you did it right she'll say you'll make a great dad and ship immediate replacements.  

I did this for a friend and got her(three addresses, three names) a 150$ bad ass breast pump, two sets of special titty bottles, and a 200$ wireless video baby monitor that I'm probably keeping because it's bad ass.

And I still can't add tags :(
