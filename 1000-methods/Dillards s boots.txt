Dillards's boots are pretty expensive .
But they have some pretty lenient customer service .
Head over to : http://www.dillards.com/shop/
Choose a nice pair of expensive boots you wish to get .
Contact their customer service complaining your boots tore after you wore them twice .
They'll ask for a receipt , and most probably send you a new one .
If they do ask them back , say you need to wear them daily for work , and get them to cross-ship you .

Cheers !
