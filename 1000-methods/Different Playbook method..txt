Hi lads.
This is how i got my Playbook.
Registered serial etc.
I then called, did basic troubleshooting and i was told they would replace it etc etc and that they would send out a box.
I was just going to box Blackberry, but basically i got sidetracked and forgot all about it.
2 weeks after i had recieved the box i noticed it laying around my room.
I called Blackberry and said that i've sent it off and had they recieved it, i then spoke to the supervisor.
She said because they had not recieved the Playbook they can't replace it.
I told her how disapointed i was and that i will never use Blackberry again.  She then offered to  contact the post office i said i sent it off from.  She then contacted me the next day and said she would replace the Playbook, and give me a nifty little leather cover.

TL;DR: Got Playbook without sending in Playbook/Boxing.
