Herro ferrow Asians,

I'm working on an online PID generator (like astropid, but online)
currently I only have the PS vita serial & model algorithm.
(from http://astropid.com/forums/showthrea...hm-DO-NOT-LEAK)

The URL is http://www.jillescode.com/pid/

Also, if you'd like other serials to be generated, just send me the algo, I'll make it webbased!
