I had bought a coat from Debenhams a year ago and noticed it was peeling because of the material it was made from.

So I went in and they said its past the 30 day policy, but you speak to a manger and tell them its not the quality you expect from them and just make sure she feels bad for you. The person will probably say they'll send an e-mail to the Head office and keep you updated. 

Luckily, the person who helped me was a lady who understood the "sad"ness I had and called me back 3 hours later and said she is sending out a £100 gift card!

Now this can be done multiple times! How? 

Debenhams has other brands within its stores from companies like Jaques-vert who will also believe your story and offer you a giftcard!

I understand this is pretty "easy" but it involves you playing your cards right to get them to call or e-mail head office to get some action.
