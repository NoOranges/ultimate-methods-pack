I used Memorex brand dvd-r's only because that's the last brand I bought and I had an old STAPLES receipt laying around (plus I was running out of them). I dont think they verify the receipts but, don't take my word for it. All I did was shop the date on my old receipt.

1) Go to there support site @ http://www.memorex.com/en-us/Support/

2) Choose your product type, group and family (I chose a 16x DVD-R 50 pack spindle) then under contact support select "GO".

3) Fill in your name, address, email, product name and for serial# I just entered the UPC number of item. (Google is your friend)

4) Under Question just write the issue with the item your SEing. It doesnt matter what, Im not gonna write what I wrote word for word but, it was along the lines of...none of my dvd-r's work, do these have any warranty??

5) After you send the question you'll get back a response in a day or two like this: http://i.imgur.com/BuveG.png In my case ALL FIFTY DVD-R DID NOT WORK :p

6) Shop a receipt, provide info asked, wait approx 2 weeks and start burning movies and selling them!

7) This  has been brought to you by me. Thank you and come again.
