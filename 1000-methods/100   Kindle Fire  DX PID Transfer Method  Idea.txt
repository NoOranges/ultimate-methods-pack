Hello, and today I bring you a method that will save you the trouble of searching for random PID and serial numbers for Kindle DX and Fires. First find the serial of the Kindle you wish to use. 

Go to Amazon.com and go to the support. 

Use the online chat since it is easier to do and less risky, for the risky ballzy people call-in. 

Simply explain to them how you purchased a Kindle Fire / DX online and how you would like to transfer the PID / Serial number to your Amazon.com account so you can have the warranty services.

The Amazon.com Representative should have no issues doing this for you. Just simply explain how you purchased it (make up an excuse) and more then likely she/he will do it for you. If anything goes wrong and they decide not to, ask for their supervisor, everything should be fine by then.

Enjoy, and don't saturate !
