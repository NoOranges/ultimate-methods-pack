I've not been super active the past week, so I'm making up by releasing 2 unique VIP methods, this being one.
It's been tested and is working in the UK.

It's a klean kanteen insulated bottle / flask.
I won't spoon feed nobody a excuse, use your imagination and check out their warranty page
(which more or less tells you how to do it):
(google it sorry, don't want them to see the referral was astropid).

The claim form is also at the bottom of that page, it took around 10 days for them to reply to me, but once they did they offered an instant replacement of my 16oz flask, no PoP, no pics, no receipt. They do make several products by the way and different sizes too.

Don't saturate it too quickly, I think the team are small.
