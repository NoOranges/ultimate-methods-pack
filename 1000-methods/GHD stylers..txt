Alright, you are allowed to do whatever you want expect leaking. 

GHD makes HQ hair stylers for Women as far as I know, they do not make products for males. However they retail for a hell allot. 

Step 1: Get a serial and bypass the hologram thing

Step 2: Contact them and say it's not working (use a female name)

Step 3: They will sometimes ask you to send it in

Step 4: Say you need it asap for your weeding or whatever.



That's it. No serial, no box.

Enjoy, now go sell on your school for 400USD. ;)
