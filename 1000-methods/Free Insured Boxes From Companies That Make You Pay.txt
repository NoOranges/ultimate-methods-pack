Hello, 

Ok so this was an old post that was gravedug. heres the method. 

Hello, 


Today I will teach you how to get free prepaid boxes from 
companies that usually make you pay for them 


(like dell.... GRRR...)


This is extremely easy so I will get right to the point. 


usually when they are setting up a prepaid box for you they 
tell you it will cost X amount of dollars for shipping and insurance. 


All you need to do is give them a prepaid VCC thats empty and have 
them run the card. They will run it and it won't go through. 


They will ask if you have another card or debit card etc. 


Just flip out and say its a Visa Gold, Amex Platinum, Mastercard Buisness card 
or something along those lines and that you spent 400$ on groceries today but 
it can't pay for a stupid "X" amount of dollars box. Blame it on their system 
and they will comp you for the box. Easy as that. 


This helps greatly when doing the BOX methods !


Goodluck and enjoy
