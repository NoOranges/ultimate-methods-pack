You want this $400 speaker? http://www.bhphotovideo.com/bnh/controller/home?O=&sku=881946&Q=&is=REG&A=details 

Well, all you really have to invest is about $40-$50 and some time.

Instructions: 


Get Beats Dr. Dre Speaker Serial (Very easy if you go to Best Buy, they don't cover them up)
Contact Beats and complain that you bought the speaker about 2-3 months ago and it won't turn on, etc
They will ask if you have PoP, say yes you have the online receipt (Amazon, NewEgg, BestBuy, etc)
They will give you a label to print out and send it in, you have to pay for the shipping and for the box
Spoof the weight of the box (I used dry ice) You may not have to spoof the weight but I recommend it
Send it out with a printed copy of the receipt, shipping with a weight of 5 pounds to there place from my state costs about $30, my ice costs $20
They will get the box, call you, and say that there was nothing in the box about 5-7 days after you ship it
You claim that you put it in there and they will offer a replacement because the package was "stolen"


I'm sure you could do cheaper beats products such as there tiny headphones which you could not have to spoof the weight at all because it weighs just about nothing. Keep this in VIP please.
