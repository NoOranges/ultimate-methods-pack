Hey guys, i'm back with another tutorial. This one's about kindles. 

Difficulty 2/10

Let's get right into it. You need:
An amazon account you own with a serial, with warranty, address and pre paid card with at least 1$ on it.
SE skills

Step 1. Contact kindle support through phone.

Step 2: Verify any information they ask, such as name email etc.

Step 3. Here is the SE. Say either the kindle dosent charge or there are black lines on the screen. 

Step 4. After some basic troubleshooting, you should be asked for an address to ship the kindle to.

Step 5. They should say to send back the kindle, however all you need to do is receive the new kindle and call in saying you sent your old one back.

Enjoy :) I'd say the only hard part about it is getting an un-used serial in warranty. Contact me if you want to buy DX serials!
