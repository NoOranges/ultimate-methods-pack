Well, since i got demoted i suppose i can actually attempt to post a method for once.

This is a simple method that requires not that much effort on your behalf. You may be able to do other items that isn't socks but i did socks just to see if i could get anything out of them  

First off it's just the simple "My socks threading was ruined" or some other excuse you will make up. I'm not going to just simply tell you exactly what to do as you should have multiple things that come to mind when SE'ing clothing items. Their contacts is as follows and i'm pretty sure they only work for the US.. so i guess people in the UK could try but more than likely it won't work out so well.

I would probably pre-make a receipt just to be safe if they ask for one. They never asked for one from me but that doesn't mean they won't ask for one from you. Do a little research and see if Amazon even has the items before you do Amazon receipts. If they ask you to send them back simply give them a reason as to why you can't and you should be fine.. not sure since they didn't ask me. ALSO, I'm pretty sure they have a very small support so this is very easily patched.. so don't all just message them at once. Not very detailed but it shouldn't be really detailed as you now have a company and can just come up with stuff yourself to get the items you want.
