Works on various Cigar brands, some ranging from £300+

Find the brand you're after, and email them describing a problem for example ; High humidity leading to uneven distribution of moisture bringing on burn problems, or unwrapping of the Cigar. 

They will replace the product no questions asked, you might have to wait a week for a reply though.

Reason why it's non PM only is that quite alot of brands are available to SE.

Pretty simple if you ask me, also if you're looking for accessories PM me for the website.
