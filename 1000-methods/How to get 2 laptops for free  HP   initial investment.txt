We're VIP so i'll keep this short and to the point.

1: buy an HP laptop from amazon

2: shipping claim/ refund the laptop

Now that you have your first free laptop, you need to exploit its warranty.
HP will offer a replacement after your machine fucks up 3 times

3: call hp and say harddrive is fucking up, they'll AR a new hardrive for YOU to install yourself. slam the HD on ground so its fucked and send it in ( do this 3 times)

4: setup a x-ship with hp

5: box them bitches
