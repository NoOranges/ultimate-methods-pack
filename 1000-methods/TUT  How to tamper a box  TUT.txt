Okay lets tamper a box today...

0. Preperation
Grab the following items

Knife / Scissors (Or hands if you are the hulk)
Gloves (not required but reccomended incase they go hurr police investigation)
Tape (Not the same kind as company, more on this later)


1. Weight
Dont put sand and shit in it... Use Home pickup or a drop box that way they dont weigh the box on receiving.

2. The box (inside)
Now lets get on to that tampering (gloves on) , remove the documents that they want you to keep (terms of service and shit). Then put in the packaging materials (foam or plastic to hold your device), If the packaging is a small bag  rip that open then dont tape it back together. 

3. The box (outside)
Now tape up your box with the required tape (put them gloves on O.J) then cut your tape. Then pull out your handy dandy tape, you should use different type then they provide ( if they give you brown, use clear etc.). Once you've taped your box up grab that nice box and give it a few wacks on the side of your desk or another 90 degree angle area, dent up the area around the tape so it ends up looking like someone was in a hurry and dropped it or some shit.

4. The pickup
Call FedEx/UPS to arrange pickup (if drop box is too far away), they will ask you for weight of box obviously you will say the weight of the box with the item in it (guess, it doesnt have to be exact). Put package on your doorstep and stay inside let them grab it and its good game.

Any questions? pm me
