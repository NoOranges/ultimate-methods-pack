To Kick this whole thing of you would start but calling up intel support.
go to http://www.intel.com/support/feedback.htm?group=processor
and click under the live chat still need help then choose your countrys number and call them.
This step is easy, Tell them the proccesor you have tell them it's stopped working, you have tried it in another system the same and it did not work. also you tried another of the same type cpu with the pc that the broken one was not working in and it worked great,
so he/she will take and email from you say it's strange ect, and you will get an email similar to this. I would of screen capped this one but it is to long.
Thank you for contacting Intel® Technical Support.
As previously discussed, we need a full system configuration in order to identify the root cause of the issue correctly and being able to provide an adequate solution.
All part numbers needed should be read directly from the component itself and not from within software which very often only show the specs of the product but not the relevant information we need.
