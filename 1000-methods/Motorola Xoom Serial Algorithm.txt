I just solved Motorola Xoom serial algorithm and I will send it to Variables, so he can add it to MagicPID 5. Before the update comes, you can ask one serial from me, if you need it. I should be able to generate 855 serials with this pattern. All of them aren't working, but over 50% of them have worked for me and you can check them on Motorola's sites.

So if you want one serial, PM me.
