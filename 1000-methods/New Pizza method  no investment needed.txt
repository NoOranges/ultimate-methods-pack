Okay guys well this isn't a huge method release, but I will be doing a few big releases soonish once they are idiot proof.
Anyway this is just a simple trick I use to get free Pizza and it always works.

Pizza boxes in my country have a sticker on them that reacts to heat, so if the pizza is hot the sticker says hot. However there is a thing on every boxing saying "if you cant see the word hot the whole order is free".

So i just palm an ice-cube, then hold it on the sticker, then kindly point it out to the pizza guy.

If he touches it and warms it up again, just say you saw him rub it and if he jacks up about it call the pizza place and be like the pizza was cold the sticker didn't say hot then the delivery boy rubbed it in-front of me to try make it say hot again. They generally apologize and let you keep it free. If not simply lose your shit and say that its not on, thats considered fraud and you get a new pizza.

Sorry its not something bigger but I figured some new guys might like it and it will give them a taste of face to face SE'ing and slight of hand.
