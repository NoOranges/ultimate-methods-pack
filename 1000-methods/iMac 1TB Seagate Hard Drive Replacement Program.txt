Hi everyone !

A friend gave me a link of the Apple iMac 1TB Seagate HDD replacement program. So this is an easy SE.

Here's the link:
-> http://www.apple.com/support/imac-harddrive/

Requirements:
All you need is a serial of an iMac bought between May and June 2011 (both 21.5 and 27 inches).


Simply do the box method.


I didn't tried it but I will work for sure.



Apple recommends SEing them to replace affected hard drives as soon as possible. Before you go in for service, please back up your data. Learn more about backup options.
