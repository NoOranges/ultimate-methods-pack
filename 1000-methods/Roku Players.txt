This probably will become saturated sometime in the near future but I decided to release it anyway. (For the people who don't know it)

What you will need:
A serial number, model number. And possibly a PoP depending on how saturated it is now.
A simple biohazard method

Basically go to http://www.roku.com/roku-products#3

Pick the product you'd like to SE and click on "What's included" at the bottom.

Research it a little bit so you get the just for it and then go to http://support.roku.com/home

Calling would be ALOT easier, however if you are too scared to let your nuts hang then email them about a "problem" it had.

They will try to trouble shoot you, tell them nothings working and how you blew all this money on a faulty product. 

They'll setup an RMA exchange for you. Say ok and eventually hang up the call.

Now all you have to do is wait a day or two and call them back up saying you went to the Post Office to ship your item after work and 
you accidently cut yourself while packing up the Roku player into the box.

They will insist on having the product back before sending you replacement but with enough whining you should be forwarded to their escalation team. 

One you've been forwarded you should get a Email/Call back in a few days with confirmation you're getting your Roku.


Enjoy and don't leech
PS: When mine came in the mail they included the Roku 2XD (Which is what I SE'd) and a regular Roku 2  :D
