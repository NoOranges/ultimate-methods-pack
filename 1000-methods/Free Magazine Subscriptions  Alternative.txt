Been using this method for a over a year now, haven't seen it on the net so I thought it would be a decent share.

> Find the website of the magazine you want
> Find the link to subscribe
> Fill in your address **With a fake name**
> Click bill me later

If the magazine asks for other personal information to register you, make everything else up and use a disposable/extra email address if you're paranoid.

So simple! Now after the period you are subscribed to is over, you will get a bill in the fake name you provided. Call up the company and say "Fake name" lived there before you and you have no clue where they went. They will say thank you and have a nice day.

It has been working for me flawlessly.

Enjoy!
