*NOTE* I have gotten beats but didnt bother using this method.

Method One

1. You will have to buy some fake Dr. Dre Beats before you could do
this. They are cheap and you will make your money back. The best
places to get these are websites like TradeTang.com,
DealXtreme.com, and DHGate.com. There are many more like this,
make a Google search for "Chinese wholesale" and you'll find some
good sites. You could also search "replica Dr. Dre Beats" They will be
no more then $50 and no less than $15.
2. After you get your fake Dr. Dre Beats, make sure they look real. If
they look like shit, then just return them and find more fake ones.
3. Go to a retailer that carries Beats, make sure you check first or
else you'll look stupid. No matter what you do, don't choose Best
Buy. The best bet is Walmart, there employees are stupid and don't
care.
4. When you have picked your retailer, head on over there and tell
them that you bought these for your brother as a gift and he doesn't
have an iPod or listen to music so he doesn't need them. They will
ask for a receipt, tell them that you don't have one. Most likely you
will get store credit, say alright and go buy something you like,
maybe real Beats!


Method two



1. You will need to buy some real looking fake Beats again. Look
above for the sites to get them, TradeTang, DealXtreme etc.
2. Go back to a retailer and buy Real Beats, the same model as your
fake.
3. When you get home, swap the Beats. Keep the real ones at home
and put the fake ones in the package and head over to the retailer.
4. Go to the return desk and tell them that you bought them as a gift
and the person doesn't want them.
5. Since you have no receipt, you'll get store credit. Buy something
valuable and sell it online.
