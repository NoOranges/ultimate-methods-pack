Here is a method to get Patriot Memory things such as USB's, RAM etc.

This is MY method which I created.

1) Go this link: http://patriotmemory.com/support/techSupportp.jsp
2) Select the product you want.
3) Go the next page and press No.
4) Enter your details like name, address, email etc.
5) For "Devices or Systems" put USB 
6) For OS put Windows 7 or XP.
7) For your problem description, make something up. For example: (I put in the  to make sure nobody copy and pastes)
Hello,
I recently got this USB from Amazon  and when I went to use it, it didn't work . I contacted Amazon and they told me to contact you. 
I went through all the troubleshooting steps and the USB still doesn't work at all. No response  at all.

Please help
Sorry, but I had to put the [] stuff to make sure nobody copy and pastes. Make up something like that.

8) You will get a email asking for more details and another email saying that a RMA case has been created.
9) You will later get a email saying that you need to ship your product back. Make sure they don't say they are giving you a box to ship it in. If they do, you can still do this, but I don't think it will work as well.
10) Wait a few days and email them and ask if they have received your product. They will say no.
11) Wait a few days and call them and ask what's happening. You will have to give the RMA number etc.
12) They will say that they have not received it and ask for a receipt. Say that you never got one or anything, but you will go down to the post office and try and get one.
13) Call back later giving a reference number etc. and say that they couldn't give a receipt.
14) They will tell you that they have received the product and they have shipped a new one.
15 ) Congrats!

Good luck! It worked for me!
