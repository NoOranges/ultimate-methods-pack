I see folks posting for 5$ or enough cash to buy a receipt or service tag all the time.  This is the classic short change scam(thousands of years old) and lets you get 10 - 100 dollars from your local gas station in just a few minutes.  I used this a lot in High School when I was totally broke but the friend I was with wasn't, I'd use his 30$ to make my own 30$ :D  

Now PAY ATTENTION since some people have reported this as being too complex&#8230;
You&#8217;ll start with a $10 bill, a $5 bill, and 15 $1 bills.
Buy something for under $5.Pay with a $10 bill.
As your change of up to $5 is being retrieved, ask for another $10 bill for ten $1 bills you&#8217;re pulling out of your wallet.
Leave your original $5 change out, but pick up the $10 bill while you hand over only nine $1 bills.
Have them check the count as you go through your wallet, putting away the $10 bill and pulling out more singles.
They will count nine $1 bills, so you add 1 more $1 bill and throw on another five $1 bills and a $5 bill and ask for a $20 bill. Cashiers always like to make smaller change for their drawer.
They put the fifteen $1 bills and one $5 bill away and give you a $20 in return.
You just made $10.

If you have to go back and read this sequence again, you&#8217;ll realize how confusion is the key here. In fact, if you are ever caught, you can claim confusion yourself. The trick is to start the second transaction before the first transaction is complete. While this scam works anywhere, it&#8217;s more often attempted where it&#8217;s noisy or busy, or where the cashier is otherwise distracted &#8211; possibly by your own charming conversation.

Up the size of the bills and up your profit.
