Hello, recently I saw quite a few people discussing shipping claims and I experienced some problems with it too, so I thought I would share. 
The purpose of this thread is to help us - users share information about stores and get the biggest advantage. 
PLEASE DO NOT ALL JUMP ON ONE STORE AT A TIME, let someone test it before...

First of all, as many of you know amazon.com is one of the easiest to do the claim with. However, about 4 days ago, they contacted me saying that my account is being investigated and they even kind of threatened me. Nothing too major, but still had to contact the asap, calm them down so they wouldn't get crazy and ask UPS to blacklist the address or something. 

Anyways, next store - walmart.com. It used to be super easy, just contact them, tell them it's not here - they give you refund instantly. However, from recent experience I can tell it became harder and those idiots are now trying to investigate (tried it on fresh account with fresh address)... Anyways, leave this one alone for some time.

As posted by another forum user SuperBiiz.com worked before, but since too many people jumped on this small company, they now investigate. Users report that they investigate even for $120 item... Not worth it.

Bhphotovideo.com - pulled of one for ~$700 before, but they did investigation and made sign BS papers. Not recommended.

Buy.com - worked a couple times before, until they asked to sign papers and send copy of ID.

Tigerdirect.com - not worth it, they investigate.

Newegg.com - not worth it, they investigate.

Bestbuy.com - works for cheaper items, from my experience anything above 400-500 will not fly easily.



Please post your experiences and sites that work. Thanks.
