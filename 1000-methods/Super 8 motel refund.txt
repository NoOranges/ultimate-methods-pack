I just got back from a trip and stayed at super 8 just to try to see if a refund was possible since they're a chain. 

1. Get a smoking room

2. contact them days after your visit saying the room smelled like garbage, cigs and weed.

3. They will call you, say you didn't ask for a smoking room.

4. Refund!

I am sure this works with any chain motel/hotel place.
