NOTICE THIS WILL ONLY WORK TILL MONDAY BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN THE LIGHTNING DEALS END.

What's needed-
1. Amazon account in good standing- Address doesn't matter
2.Must be anytime from now to 11/26 (cyber monday) or during any lighting deals
3. Time/dedication and the ability to sound pissed off/lie


Method:
1. Look around for good upcoming lightning deals. They must be something big like a laptop,tv, tablet ect because they need to be 100 percent claimed very quickly.

2. Once you have your mark wait until the lightning deal comes up. Have two pages open one with the lightning deal, one with the product your going to fake buy. As you click claim when it opens up, press refresh on the other product page. The goal is to make the amazon system freak the fuck out, so it says 0 percent claimed or a weird number claimed. Do whatever you need to fuck with the page. I ended up opening another browser, placing it my cart in one and taking it out on another, and claiming multiple times. If you get it to mess up your golden and its time to move on to step 3. (it might be a good idea to take screenshots of the website messing up.) If you don't then choose another item or be a good liar.

3. Wait until the deal is over (usually about two hours) and then call amazon. Complain your ass off to everyone and escalate it to the manager ( hope u have a nice one). Make sure you put the blame on amazon NOT U BEING TOO SLOW- THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. If you get put on hold THIS IS GOOD. You can complain about that too and be more likely to get credit. I got put on a hold a total of 4 hours between chat and waiting to be called back. (Do some other stuff while your waiting)

4. Ask amazon to give you some sort of credit and/or honor the deal. DO NOT LET THEM SAY THEY CAN'T DO ANYTHING FOR YOU. Trust me they can. The manager has the right to give promotional credit.  

If the item is still available ask them to give you the same percentage off that item to buy it now
If the item is not available ask them for a partial credit now.

5. IF you have a nice enough manager and your SEing skills are good enough you should get some type of credit. They gave me the same 20 percent off the item as a promotional credit. IE. $120 amazon credit (yes you read that right). My brother got a $30 credit because the tv was out of stock on amazon. So choose something you think they probably have a lot of stock of.

6. SPEND THE MONEY QUICKLY BEFORE AMAZON REALIZES THEY FUCKED UP AND YOU DON'T WANT THAT ITEM. Personally I got two copies of black ops II as presents for people. Hopefully they won't get cancelled :D


Warning- ONCE YOU USE THE CREDIT, THAT IS IT. DO NOT TRY AND CANCEL AN ORDER OR RETURN IT FOR CREDIT. YOU WILL LOSE THE PROMOTIONAL CREDIT AND/OR THE ITEM.

I lost 10 bucks because I didn't know that.
