So every employee can actually change what the sale price of something is.

1) tell them you want your pizza well done (aka a little more cooked) then call back in say its burnt.
2) Call and tell them you got a coupon in the mail (This one works for specialty pizzas too so save like 10 bucks)   say "I got a coupon in the mail for any 2 Large pizzas any way I want it for 9.99 each. (order that expensive stuff and save WAY OVER $10  I hear this one kinda often sometimes).
3) Ive heard (I got a coupon in the mail for 1 free large I THINK) can always say it was accidentally another place if they deny
4) the dominos at our town quit giving these out but yours might accept it. say you want 2 Mediums for 5.99 each (used to be a huge deal)
5)Call and say they got the order wrong, I havent heard of any of our drivers saying they asked to see the pizza.
6) If you want to treat the crew to a meal or if you know someone that knows themDONT BE SUSPICIOUS.  You can call in an order and then later call and say you thought it was the town 15 miles away, or fake an phone number and give a bad name address(dominos screen does show auto fill address's so dont go 100000th street haha. The pizza goes to the crew or the friend of the crew can stop in say whats up and have a few bites or maybe take it away.
7) IN the unlikely event we are SWAMPED make an order and if it is an hour late its free.

Mookman bids you good dominos :P... ALSO if you work for a food place like dairy queen or something here is an idea. Our domios manager actually traded 3 medium pizzas for an ice cream cake from Dairy Queen.
