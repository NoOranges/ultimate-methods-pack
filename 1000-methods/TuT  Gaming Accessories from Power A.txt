*I am not sure if this will work with anything else, however I have just gotten a Pro Elite Wireless controller using this method. It required no call-in or POP.*

1. Choose a product.

2. Email customerservice@PowerA.com describing a problem with your item. I described mine as having a problem with having a massive deadzone in the the analog sticks.

3. Wait maybe a day for a response. Mine arrived around 36 hours later.

4. Recieve shipment.

***UPDATE*** 

Users have reported that they do want you to ship the defective product back "at your earliest convenience". However to make things seem less suspicious, just make an excuse saying that the product has somehow left your possession.

***PROOF PICS***
