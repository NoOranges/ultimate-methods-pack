Method: 
Do a general Support Inquiry,e-mail preferred, you can try calling if you want.
Say it worked for a few days and suddenly it became paperweight (it completely stopped working).
They will e-mail you back telling you to do a few troubleshooting steps and then you reply back saying it didn't work and that the LED's aren't even turning on or blinking or anything and the usual yada-yada, then they will conclude it is hardware failure. They will then forward it to a replacement rep. who will tell you to ship it in and do a standard RMA.

Now here is where you get creative; make up a reason why you can't send the item back first (leaving on a trip ASAP and need a charger, or you can't wait the month-long process etc.). The more original your excuse is, the better the chance of it working. If you can convince them they will ask for a reciept, make sure its a legit one, and here's where you guys got lucky, Groupon sold A LOT of this exact product for $25 or so a few weeks ago, so a lot of people would have this item and are selling it to make a quick buck, get a reciept off them. Once the reciept is verified, they will ask for a CC, give em a VCC with $2 in it, that worked for me, and they didn't ask for a serial, but they might start asking for them if too many people mess this up. Once the pack arrives, dump the crap and keep the gizmo, charge your shit etc. etc.

PM me if you need help, I'll try my best to assist you.

I did this with; E-mail, $2 VCC, a REAL Reciept from USA.  They ship to USA and Canada from what I can tell. Other countries are welcome to try.
