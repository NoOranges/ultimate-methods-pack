I know this is a well known method, but I'm actually extremely surprised that it worked with this company. Most of you know how to do this, but I'll give you steps anyway.

Step 1:

Go here and BE SURE to fill out your real information - https://www.thehersheycompany.com/contact-us/contact-us-form.aspx

Step 2:

Tell them you bought a 36 pack of Hersheys Candy Bars (would work with other candies too, I'm sure), and come up with a viable excuse to why you were extremely dissatisfied. Ask them if there's 'any way' they can send you a refund. Be sure to tell them that you threw away the packaging prior to sending the e-mail

Step 3:

Wait, and get your check.

NOTE: Also works with Wonka, any Kraft foods, Link Snacks (Jack Links) and Conagra Foods (Slim Jims).

Good luck, and enjoy your free cash (;
