Right the old method of disputing the payment on Paypal no longer works, this one requires you to buy one pizza.

1. Firstly buy a pizza from dominos. I would recommend to use the deal "Early Week Special- Large" for ?12.99
2. After receiving your email you can obviously try and dispute but will most likely be stopped. Instead contact your local store via email and come up with an excuse like you received the wrong pizza and it was cold etc.
3. You should receive an email a couple of days later from the manager of the particular store, most likely offering you free pizza.

This is the email I received:
I send my apologies on behalf of my ------------- Branch of Domino Pizza in regards to them sending you a Meateor instead of a Mighty Meaty, the codes for these Pizza's is MT & MM and so clearly one of my staff has misread and made you the wrong pizza or they've put it in the wrong box.
 
Either way i appreciate it is most frustrating for you as you did not get what you ordered. I have demanded that my team there pay more attention and stop silly mistakes like this from occurring.
 
In the meantime by way of a further apology allow me to offer you 2 free large Pizza's of your choice when you next use us. Please mention this email when ordering and hand a copy to my staff on receipt of your Pizza.
 
Once again my sincere apologies over this mishap.
 
Regards
