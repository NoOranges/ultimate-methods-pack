This method is for a Macro lens that will fit onto about any smart phone I thought it was pretty killer to take pictures of bud with it.


First off head over to

or email them at info@easy-macro.com


Now you must tell them a problem you noticed with the product here are a few examples do not use word for word as again this is a small company like my last post try not to rape them.



The lens is fogged up and looks milky in color
The band is separating from the lens



After that your all set they said they have never seen them milky color before but they sent me out a new one cause all of these new companies do not know any better.

Best of luck to you all!
