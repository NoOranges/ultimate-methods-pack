Hey guys here is a method to getting sink filter/ shower head filters and other filters and cartridges with applying no work at all except for a fake amazon PoP.

Took me 3 emails and they respond quick.

Go to http://www.culligan.com/ContactUs.aspx

Tell them that the item you are using broke off (if using a shower head filter or water sink attachment filter) when you turned it on or something.

Give name , phone, address and pop....next email is confirmation for replacement.
