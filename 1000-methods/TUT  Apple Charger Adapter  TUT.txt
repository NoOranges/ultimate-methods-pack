Have you every received anything from Apple like iPad or iPhone or iPod but when you received them you didn't had the cable to sync to itunes or didn't had charger.

Or do you just need another charger for your mac or ipod?

So Call Apple at 1-800-APL-CARE
or Chat (I cant find any link so if any1 has it I will add it to this thread, thx)
and tell them "that your charger was plugged in and it suddenly stopped working, charging my iDevice."
Or say "that there was a smoke coming out of the charger and stopped working."
Or say "the charger became very hot and turned a little black, so I threw it away."
BE CREATIVE!

Because of their overnight shipping you get it the next day.

they might or might not ask for serial no. from your idevice.
and here is proof:
