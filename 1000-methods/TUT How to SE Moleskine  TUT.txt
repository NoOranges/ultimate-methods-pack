Hey guys! This is I think my second tutorial?
Maybe first, so today I am going to teach you how to SE Moleskine (Professional Notebook)
I got mine yesterday.

Okay lets get started!

1. Get a PID off AstroPID program.

2. Go to the website: http://www.moleskine.com/

3. Click online shop and find a product you like!

4. Go to the contact page: http://www.moleskineus.net/moleskine-email.php?firsttime=1

5. Make up an excuse like the notebook had scuffs all over it or some pages were ripped, etc.
and use a picture like this: http://www.recordingthoughts.com/wp-images/brokenmolseskine_small.jpg
