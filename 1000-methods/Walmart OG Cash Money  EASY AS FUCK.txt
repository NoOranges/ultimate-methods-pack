NIGGGAAA GET YO FRESSH CASSSHHHHH NIGGAAAAAAAA
---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Pick out a M rated game and buy it
2. Save the receipt and come back a week later
3. Now go back to the store with the receipt and game. Now you must come back with an angry expression. Like an angry mother expression. This is the part to play it off.
4. Demand to speak to the manager. The store clerks don't give a shit. Managers on the other hand want to keep customers happy. If the manager isn't buying into your story demand to report the store to walmart HQ. Now that will really tick him off and want to do something
5. Now that you have him demand to be compensated. Now try to guilt him in saying "My son saw people getting shot" for a game like COD. You tried so hard to get your son away from these game and then a cashier decides  to sell a game that is rated M to your son without a ID and didn't ask for one.
6. If it all played out the game will be refunded, or you keep the game, and you can get compensated

They "were very sorry for the incident"  and basically I gave them the game and I got $100...

Thanks to OG @N3wb Hacker  for the help finding this shit..
