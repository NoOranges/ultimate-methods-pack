The chop shop:

used to be real heavy in IRL crime before evolving my skills to internet shit. 

you DO need investment, a GOOD crew (like 6-8 people), a concealed place to work, mechanic skills, body work skills.

Not going to go COMPLETELY in-depth with this, as its a shitton of work to be done, but ths will put you on the right track. (not that most of you pussies will have the nuts to do this shit anyways)

I'm going to use a 2006 Ford F150 for example.

Go out and STEAL an 06' F150.

Take that shit to your shop and COMPLETELY disassemble the mother fucker.

Now comes the tricky part, Changing the VIN number.

Go to a junkyard and find a 06' F150 frame in decent condition WITH the rear axle (has the VIN stamped on it so you need to switch it out) there's also a bunch of other places where the VIN is stamped to locate them and swap the parts. (inside driver side door jam, somewhere on the engine, inside the dash, SWAP THEM ALL)

Re-assemble your truck on the JUNK YARD frame with the JUNK YARD TRUCK's VIN numbers.

You should be able to get the vehicle AND swap frames/parts in a day or two tops with a decent crew.

Go get a salvage title, go get it some plates.

You've now stolen a truck AND made it legal again (technically)

You MAY get stopped by cops as they will be looking for said vehicle, so new paint is a good idea, but not a must.
IF you get stopped, they'll run your plates (which will be legit), look at the VIN# to match t to the stolen truck (which it fucking wont), then send you on your way.

Don't fucking get caught.
