As we all know, if you want to SE a cheque you have to give them your real info. That is, up until now. 
Recently, PayPal has made a service where you can cash in a cheque through their mobile application.
As long as the name matches the name on the cheque, this should cash into your balance. 

1. Make fake PayPal account. Make sure it is US and has the correct name on it. I would also use a VPN if you don't want your legit account limited.
2. SE the cheque. I won't go into many details here, there are multiple ways to do it, many tutorials on the first page.
3. Log into your PayPal, go into your balance details (http://bit.ly/LzGlim) and click "Add money from checks"
4. Make sure you sign the back with your SEing name! Very important.
5. Take snap shots of both the front and back of the cheque. (http://bit.ly/JM6Q2w)
6. Afterwards, enter the amount for the cheque.
7. Wait around a week or so, then your PayPal balance should have increased by the amount in the cheque. :)
There is a limit of $1000 per day, and $3000 per month for cashing in cheques.

Please note: I am NOT responsible if anything happens to your PayPal account if you use this method.
