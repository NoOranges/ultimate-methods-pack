Been busy, so I didn't share much methods, beside that in contrib, anyway I don't know how many people actually need this, but might come handy sometimes.


1. Website is http://store.solio.com/Solio-Store/Solio-Bolt-Solar-Charger-S620-AH1RW
 I guess you can try other stuff, I didn't so I can't guarantee.


2. Contact http://store.solio.com/site/solio/support-form.html


3. Send some excuse about product working partly since they will stubbornly insist to send charger to them first (at least that was the case with me).


4. Meantime they will ask for receipt. This is where astroproof works.

5. As I said, they will insist for you to send it back, but just persist with your excuse and they will send the replacement.
