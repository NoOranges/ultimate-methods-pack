Now either are just fine and we'll get into how to manipulating people in your lives to print money for you!
Ok now we all know Amazon is the place to be for shipping claims however the problem is that they can only be done twice in a month before an address gets blacklisted or 7 times with a month gap between each claim. So let's face it what you need is people!  People get things going, so you need them!


1. Convince a friend/family member that you need to use their address to order something, now what you do now is 
A: Tell them that you want to order something expensive but you can't since
. You address keeps having it's deliveries stolen
. You don't want your parents to know your spending so much on something
. It's a present for someone who lives at your house
.Amazon won't deliver to your previous address for some reason (Make one up)
. Make up a reason the possibilities are endless.


B: If they're a good friend, and not a bitch you can tell them what your actually doing, in which case they'll probably want some money(Or something else (lol ) for partaking in you illegitimate actions so give them 15-20% of the item value no more.


Now you can either use a prepaid visa gift card(With the drops name) with the item value amount loaded on it or you can give the person the cash to do it,I prefer the prepaid gift card way much less hastle and you don't have this thought
in the back of your mind that they could fuck you over.


2. Once you have convinced them to be your drop make a new account with a newly made email(Don't fucking forget your vpn and google icognito) and order the item you want, make sure it's fuffilled by amazon(aka UPS/DPS/FEDEX/CITYLINK) so you can get a refund
items such as ipads are good to do as everyone wants one, so you can keep it and be a sheep or sell quick it to a sheep.


3. After you pick up the item, get onto getting a refund (DONT FORGET VPN/ICOGNITO) talk to the rep and say nothing was in the box/box never arrived/false signature whatever they all work, and the rep will offer you a redelivery
now that's cool an and all but we play this game for the profit, so basically say " fuck amazon I hate you and I want my money back" obviously more pollite,
Amazon think you are an honest consumer, so exploit those motherfuckers!

get a refund and cash out the visa and repeat with your next target.

4. Finally just to cover you ass incase they ever bring up what you bought, just say it was faulty/incomplete/broken and you sent it back and saved/spent your money on something else if you sold it, if you decided to keep it cool.








ITEM VALUE X NUMBER OF FRIENDS/FAMILY=$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$PROFIT$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
