Sometimes the only thing keeping you from properly raping a company is having enough drops :D  I'm super lazy so I use this constantly since it basically gets some desk jockey(or jockyette) to do one whole step for you, and some say the riskiest step.  

Use a hotel as your address and just let the hotel know that you stayed there a month ago (because you're a traveling salesman) and needed a laptop, shaver, vibrator, even TV replacement so you used their address.   Trust me, hotel workers see enough weird shit that even if you're 17 they'll find this pretty normal in comparison.

Now you're working just a few towns away but the company didn't let you change the shipping address so you'll get to drive back to the hotel when it's there.  Just act professional and kind while asking them to simply shoot you a call when it gets in and sign for it if necessary, stress that you need it asap so you'll drive straight back when it gets in(so they don't worry about having a box cluttering up the office).  

Then you'll just get a call when your item is ready to pick up, it's like a ship to store service for free shit with almost no liability :)

Also don't forget to bring the desk jockey a candy bar for their kindness, you can easily SE a big box of butter fingers just for rewarding unknowing thralls.
