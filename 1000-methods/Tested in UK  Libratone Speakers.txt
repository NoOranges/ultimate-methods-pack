This is a pretty simple method that I used a while back when I was just starting out, probably one of the best SE's I've done. Managed to net myself a £600 speaker with just a few emails, no PIDs or anything.

Requirements
- Common sense (some people on these forums are lacking)
- An email account.



Go to the Libratone website and choose the speaker you wanna get. I went for the Live AirPlay speaker which is worth about £600.
Email the support (support@libratone.com) and tell them you're having problems with your speaker. Come up with an excuse, it's not hard.
Go through the troubleshooting process with them and obviously act as if nothing is working.
They will offer to replace your speaker and ask if you'd like to send it in. Tell them you don't feel comfortable sending it in as it's very expensive and heavy.
They will offer to come and pick it up and give you a new one. Just say okay whatever.
The UK team (if you're in the UK) will contact you about it and give you a tracking number. Wait til the speaker is on the way and either; tell them that you didn't realise they were going to pick up the broken one and you got rid of it because you were getting a new one anyway... or just wait til the delivery guy comes and tell him that you spoke to Libratone and they don't want to pick it up anymore - they will usually give you the speaker without issue.
You now have your new speaker! Do want you want with it, sell it, keep it, smash it, whatever.


The end.
