So basically there was company reflexive.com that was bought some years by amazon.com . You just need to chat with amazon.com and say that you bought game some years ago, and now can't use it. Find some serial number of the game you are SE'ing and provide it to them. Result:

1572

You probably can convince them into giving gift card instead of promotional balance. That would be better, so if anyone find a way to do it please post it here
