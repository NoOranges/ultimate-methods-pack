So you've finished an SE against a small company in another country. They want your address. 

1. Give them your address but state that the company must fill out the customs form as "Media Accessory" or "Novelty ___" with a price of $__.__. 

2. Once it arrives, contact the company saying your mother paid $xx.xx amount of customs while you were away and she was furious. Demand a refund of the customs amount. 

Make your amount high or low depending on the company size. 

Enjoy!
