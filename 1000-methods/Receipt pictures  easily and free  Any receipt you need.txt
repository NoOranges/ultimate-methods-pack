Hey, this thread is about getting receipts for products for free. Some of the pictures of the receipts are editable and could be used for products other than whats on the receipt if you are a decent editor.

Basically, Hendrix posted a method about getting serials from instagram/statigram. It is basically that method but for getting receipts. Hendrix didn't mention anything about getting receipts with the method so I thought I would point it out as it is quite useful. It can take time to get the receipt you want but it should come eventually.

What you need to do is to go onto https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CDMQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fstatigr.am%2F&ei=REpDUvARyObsBrHbgfAP&usg=AFQjCNHneWBqClD05Pni4hHnGD_yL-Wfow&sig2=yJK2kVO_u5uRNVpJWD6Lyw (statigram) and sign up. Once you have signed up, there is a search bar in the top right, type into that box, "receipt".

Some options will come up as little tag boxes. Click on the box that says receipt, the one with around 30000 photos and a ton of pictures will come up of receipts. Now its up to you to scroll down the page until you find the receipt you need. I managed to find an apple receipt with a working serial on it for an iPhone 5. So the method does work and you can basically get any receipt you need for any store!

Thanks for reading and feel free to leave some rep if you enjoyed the tutorial!
