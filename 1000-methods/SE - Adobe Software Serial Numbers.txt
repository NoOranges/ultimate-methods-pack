This is very simple method.


I have tried this with adobe about 3 times and i have recieved 2x FrameMaker serial = $15,000 and 1x ColdFusion serial = $9,000


Anyways the only reason i sed serials from them was to do a refund method, which successfully worked once for $9,000 but now they changed their policy.


Anyways very simple make an account with adobe, then go to support and you have to search around a bit and find lost serial number or just go to live chat and they'll make the support case for you once you discuss your problem.


Contact adobe live chat, say you have lost your serial number and that you purchased from wherever and that you need it urgently as you have just reformatted your computer because of a virus or whatever, just be creative. You have to push them sometimes to do it, also just state you need it urgently.


If they ask if you have the receipt from where you purchased say yes, oh and you have to provide that to them.
They take a long time for giving you a serial number, so what you have to do is be persistent and keep chatting every day until they give, also keep asking for the manager etc... or someone that can give you a serial.


I might be able to make receipts for retails stores for a price so PM me if you want.


I don't care if you already knew this i just want to start contributing.


Admins mods if you wish to move this up to contributor or elite you may do so, if you wish to do the opposite you can do so, i don't care.
