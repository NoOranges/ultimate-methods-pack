Okay, I don't know if this will work just throwing this out there.

1. Go to live chat and say this: "I was on the phone with another customer service member and they said to contact you through live chat to finish my replacement order".

2. They will say what model number.  Put in any model number that you got from MagicPID

3. They will ask for shipping info

4. ???

5. Profit

Note: If they ask for a ID of some sort, say that the phone person didn't give you it.
