Okay you are going to be buying a Green Dot visa Pre-paid

they look like this http://www.7-eleven.com/images/product-view/799366639084.png 

these are sold at

- 7/11
- cvs pharmacy's
- kmart
-radioshack
-walgreens
-rite aid

you pay $5 for the card and then you have to deposit $10>

after you buy the card go  here:  https://www.greendot.com/greendot/activation/online-activation-init

now you want to fill everything in but for name and contact info and address but some fake shit obviously.

when you get to the part to put your SSN skip that and just fill everything except for that and press continue.

you are going to get an error because you didn't put your SSN, just go where it is located and check the box where it says that you dont want to put your SSN because you dont card a personalized card.

press continue again, your done

these work with nike, when doing them just tell them the address you put on that greendot and that you used to live there but moved recently so thats your billing address still
