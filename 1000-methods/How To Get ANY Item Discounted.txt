This is a REALLY complicated method and you must have a

scanner/fax machine
printer
ability to manipulate hand writing
a load of time


Now it's time to start


Find a item that is discounted
Next take the item to customer server and ask for a rain check and say you don't have the money to pay for it
They will hand you one and now go back home and scan or fax the item to your computer
Next use paint or Photoshop to erase the price
Now print it and manipulate numbers and put the price 50 dollars cheaper
Next wait a few days and go to a different store and attempt to buy the product with a hat and maybe a jacket because if the manager attempts to call the other store you can easily leave and you are not recognizable
Now this is the tricky part if the manager calls the other store say you have to go to the bathroom and head for the door. You're basically screwed if they call and you have to run when you get out. You have to park far in order for the cameras not catch your plates.
If this worked for you congratz you have saved more money


This is a REALLY risky method. Be smart in what you do
