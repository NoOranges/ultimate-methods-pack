This is a very risky method, can get you screwed over so do at your own risk.

You need a serial, a box, something to put in the box(preferably dry ice), a receipt within 30days of purchase(can be fake).

What you need to do is call HP and claim your laptop is dead on arrival. Then the rep should trouble shoot you, you go through the steps. Then the rep will say someshit like its not working and well send out a tech or you need to get it serviced. You will complain how this is unacceptable to get your brand new laptop already serviced etc... Then they will state to take it back to the store usually. You then again find an excuse to why you cant take it back. After you complain and argue abit they should budge and will ask you to ship it in. You will ask is there anyone they can send first or anything so you can receive your laptop quicker. They should then tell you about swap out. They say the courier will come and swap the new laptop with the doa laptop. You say okay. This is why you needed the box and dry ice. With the box you need to get it taped up so the courier doesnt open it and check it. Has to be around the size of the laptop you are seing. The courier will come and you will hand him over the box and hell hand over the laptop. You get an awsome HP laptop.

I just quickly explained this but it aint easy to get done. This was tested and has worked twice for me in Australia.
