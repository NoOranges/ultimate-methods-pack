EDIT - PM'd five people about this. Once they are done ill re-open and bump this thread for another five to avoid saturation !


Found an awesome company which does alot of items, from digital film camera's ect

Basically you need a serial and an empty vcc.

Email them and say that it's not working ect. They don't take products back for repair so they will offer to replace via Advanced replacement.

Simply give them a dead vcc and done ! 

Oh right the company, yeah PM me about that :L only handing out to a select few.
