I've done this SE in EU as you can see by the link of the website because I saw they are located in Berlin. I guess it will work for US too.

1. This is item that I SE'd 
http://www.just-mobile.eu/iphone/gum-doubleplus.html

2. I've noticed that there is Warranty registration on the bottom right corner so I registered some serial that I found on ebay.

3. 2-3 days after I registered it (just so it doesn't looks suspicious, but probably will work if you try it instantly), I contacted them saying I have the problem with power bank.

4. Rep tried some troubleshooting steps as always (try another USB cable, did you charge the device enough etc)

5. Since it won't work for us obviously, he asked for PoP, where I sent astroproof generated one.

6. He agreed to send replacement after which I need to ship the defective one back.
