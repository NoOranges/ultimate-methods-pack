This method is basically a shipping claim method but I find that thinkgeek is really easy to shipping claim anything you want.



Order items of your choice from thinkgeek
Wait untill you get items (so you dont actually have to file a claim)
Email thinkgeek, I never got my items!
They will reply with something like "Okay we will send you some more"
Result: 2 For price of 1 or you could return it and call it a free item


TL;DR Shipping Claims + Thinkgeek = win
