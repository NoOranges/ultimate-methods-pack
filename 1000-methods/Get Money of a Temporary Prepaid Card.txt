Most VCC's I have used, (Green Dot) to be exact, require you to verify your SSN in order to get the money off the card through an ATM. Couple ways around this.

First is to setup a paypal shop through your paypal account and buy something from yourself through the shop with the card.
This only works sometimes, and I am not sure why so I have found a more efficient way.

Second is to go to squareup.com and order one of these (they're free)
1623

Once you get your Square (requires smartphone Apple or Android) download the app, and hook it up to your bank account.
You can now successfully transfer funds into your account off the card and their fee is cheaper than Paypal.
Cheers.
