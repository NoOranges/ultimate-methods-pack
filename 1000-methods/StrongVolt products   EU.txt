Warnings about the company

- None that im currently aware of.

General Information

It's a small company. I believe they only have a few OR one representative(s).
They have a few different products, i went for their POP 360 bluetooth speakers.

My method only works for people in the EU, since this company apperently got raped before in the US, because they want to send you in the product.

Contact Information

You can contact their support via an online form on their website.

What is required

I SE'd my speakers without anything. It may occur that you need a valid receipt in order to SE one, since the method has been posted. But the last time i did them (aprox 5 or 6 weeks ago) i didn't need any requirement at all.

The method

It's relatively simple to SE one of their products, contact them with your 'problem' and troubleshoot abit, just like any other SE. But we are going to take advantage of a smart trick we can use in order to successfully complete this SE. Please read my article carefully;( http://astropid.com/forums/showthread.php?27541-Living-in-Europe-Use-this-to-your-advantage! ). After a while the support representative will tell you that he is able to make a replacement order to your address. There isn't really much more i can tell. It's very easy for us (experienced SE'ers).

My personal story;

I messaged them about my problem i had with their bluetooth speakers, their reply was really fast. Nika .B was my representative.
Then he insisted on making a return on amazon, i used my method (which i described above) and it worked flawlessly. There only was one problem.. He wasn't able to ship to europe. I totally forgot about the SE since i was focussed on my apple SE. Then after  a month or so i received a reply from Nika B. If my speaker was working again (i seriously never had such a friendly support team on my ass, logitech doesn't count with their 2-week auto message ;p) so i told him it still wasn't working properly. Then he wrote me this:

They ship it via amazon.co.uk. (Atleast my POP 360 speakers)

Thanks for watching my method, hope you like it all, EU phagz. 
Excuse me for some grammar errors, i'm not a native speaker. Could be using wrong verbs in the wrong time etc.

And btw, my method isn't for SALE.
