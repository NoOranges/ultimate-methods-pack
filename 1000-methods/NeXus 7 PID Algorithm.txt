Hello guys ,


I m going to give you guys this algorithm for Google Nexus 7 PID . As  this is my first tutorial about my algo forgive me if anything is wrong .  I know ASTROPID have this algo nonetheless but wanted to share it to  get myself some HQ member here ...

Basically this Nexus 7 Serial made of 12 alpha numeric thingy

First letter          - "C" 

Second letter      -  Random digt from 1-9

"8","6" etc (BTW I came across 8,6 mostly in many of them ).
                            Had 2 different serials from USA and UK so lets hope 
                            8- USA.
                            6- UK.

Third letter         - zero (0)

4th,5th and 6th   - "KBC"

Remaining  6-12  - Random Digits resp ..

So here is all together ..

C60KBC829262 (UK)
C80KBC105847 (USA)
C80KBC161518  (USA)

Another serial : C50XBCnnnnnn  (Thanks SuperMario)
