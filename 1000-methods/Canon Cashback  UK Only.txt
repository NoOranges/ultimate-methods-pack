Just to let you guys know. The previous canon cashback for the netherlands method that I posted seems to be going on in the UK to. Cashbacks are pretty low compared to that of my country but if you do 2 products at the same time you get 35 pound extra.

I guess you could use astroproof but I'm not sure since I dont live in the UK and cant test.
