This receipt template was made by me, and intended solely for use at the MagicPID support forums. I heard that there is a graphics section in Tier 2, but I cannot see that section yet. If a/an admin/mod would like to move it to that section, that would be great.

Please do not re-upload this file. If I find it uploaded on another site, I will imminently take down my version- and require that new uploaded one be taken down also.

Instructions:

1. Make sure you have Merchant Copy Font installed first. It can be found here for free: http://bit.ly/MerchantCopy

2. Open the template and start editing it.

3. To edit it, use the text tool and simply click on the text you want to edit. This template, like all of mine, is fully editable. Every bit of information on it can be changed to your liking.

4. I do not condone illegal activities and do not intend for this template to be used in any special way- other than for education.

EDIT:

About the virus thing- I'm on a Mac, so I can't really show a scan on the files. Enjoi vouched for me below, though.
