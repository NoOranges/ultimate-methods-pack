    Here's my story for those of you that don't want to fuck this up :P

   Hello,
    I recently purchased a very large bag of Sour Patch Kids at Costco.  I took them camping, and when I opened them, enjoyed a few.  I then looked into the bag, only to noticed small green spots all over the candies, and the inside of the bag.  A putrid smell was coming out of the bag, and I was sick for the rest of my 3 day camping trip with the family.  I'm VERY disappointed in you guys, as I had very high standards for your products.  They were not met.  Thanks for reading, 
                      Your name here.
