I personally emailed them. 
Say something like this:
I have your product in several of my offices. I love it, and it works great. However, I just purchased 1 more of the 40 sq foot clear for a new office from Lowe's, and the paint in the container was dry. Can I get this replaced? Lowe's would not take the return. 


They will reply and ask for a receipt, photoshop it.
They send replacements pretty quickly, and they ask for the old can back so they can look at it, but they never said anything when I didn't return mine.
The resellers of this on amazon are not official or whatever, so don't use those, I don't think they will work.
Keep in mind that these are hard as fuck to sell. No one buys them on eBay or Craigslist.
This is a really small company, probably one person for customer service. Please do not rape or attempt this unless you can photoshop good receipts.
