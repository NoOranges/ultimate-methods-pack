So basically i went to there website, said my hi-bounce ball wasn't bouncing over 1 metre, They then emailed me saying, That's no good what's your address we'll send a replacement, It's not much but i'm sure you could do it with other equipment from there. eg basketballs etc. Good luck  :) honestly the easiest SE ever.
