Beware these energy drinks are crazy strong and will give you the shakes if you drink too much.

First off we are going to start off by emailing them at beverage@vpxsports.com and pretty much complain about the drink. This is what I said "Hello, I recently purchased a 4 pack of redline energy drinks from walmart. I love redline energy drinks and its the only kind I'll drink but the last 4 pack I got tasted disgusting and was flat. I'm very disappointed as this is my favorite energy drink." 

They will email you back asking for the lot number, expiration date, Mailing address, and phone number. Tell them you don't have the bottles because you threw them out but you do remember the expiration date. I would just make up a date such as 5/13 or something along the lines. Then give them your phone number and mailing address. They wont call you they just need it for shipping. Then wait about a week and you will get the bottles in the mail. 


I'll post proof in a couple minutes.
