I don't really count this as an SE as all you have to do is file a complaint, but hey I thought I'd let you guys know on what is going on.

So basically Skechers has been fined $40 million to settle charges from the FTC  for making unfound claims that wearing their tone up shoes will get you a fit body like Kim Kardashian. It was actually discovered that people gained weight and not lost weight while wearing their shoes.

It's unknown on how much each person will get refunded, it all depends on the amount of people that file a claim within the 8 months they're allowing people to file for a refund.

You can go to the FTC website to file a claim. 

I can't do it as my internet/computer is being sh$tty & not letting me go to there website. But you can try it out. 

I don't know when exactly you will be refunded but hey it'll be nice to receive a nice little check just one random day.

Here's more info on the situation: http://finance.yahoo.com/news/ftc-skechers-deceived-consumers-shoe-151356627.html

This is probably the wrong section as this really isn't an SE or confirmed, so if it's not please move it to its respectable section.
