This method is a remix off of some other methods I have come across over the days.

This has a 75% success rate if done correctly. 

METHOD:

1. CALL UP ______ PIZZA

2. ORDER WHAT YOU LIKE

3. ASK HOW MUCH IT IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE A $35 BUDGET

4. WHEN THEY ASK IF CASH OR CREDIT SAY STORE CREDIT

5. THEY WILL LOOK IT UP ON YOUR PHONE NUMBER AND OBVIOUSLY NO STORE CREDIT

6. SAY THE MANAGER TOLD YOU IT SHOULD BE ON YOUR ACC BECAUSE YOUR LAST PIZZA WAS VILE

7. KEEP BITCHING FOR 2-5 MINS, THEY WILL GIVE IN.
