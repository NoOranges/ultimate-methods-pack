This method can be done in many variations and doesn't require much "Social Engineering". I will go over a few in order to give you something to work with.

1. Go to a Kindle Fire retailer (Target, Best Buy, ect.)

2. Since stores keep Kindles behind glass cases, you'll have to tell a teller your going to buy it so he will get it open.

3. He/she will take it to the counter and ring it up. This is where the variations occur.


a. MEMORIZE IT: Personally, I have a VERY good memory and can memorize a code very quickly. If you are like this, simply grab the box to look at it. On the bottom of the box there will be a bar code with a 16 digit code under it. That is the products Serial number. (NOTE: The serial number for Kindle Fires will ALWAYS start with D)

b. RECORD IT: The classic spy cam never fails. Simply turn your flip cam, iPhone, or other small media recording device on and wear a shirt with a chest pocket. Begin inspecting the box, being sure that the video camera can get it. This may take some practice, but the end result is worth it.

c. WRITE IT DOWN: This one can be a little tricky. Carry your phone with you when you get the teller. If you're using the phone, pretend your sending texts off. When the teller puts the box down on the counter, flip it over so you can read off the number. Act like your sending a text as you type in the code.


4. Once your confident you have the code, check your pockets. Try to look shocked as you realize you don't have money to pay for it. Apologize to the teller and explain that you must of left your wallet at home. If the teller offers to hold it, tell them it won't be necessary and that your sure it'll be there when you return.

And there you have it. A little more out going then the usual SE, but it works fairly well and you don't have to worry about the codes being registered.
