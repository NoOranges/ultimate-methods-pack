Hello guys, it's about time I contribute to the community.

I stumbled upon this method when my music got deleted

This method does require you to buy a song! The more songs you have = the more songs you will get back!

Make sure you read it all!

So here are the steps, let's go

1. You want to contact Apple.
 (a). Go to https://expresslane.apple.com 
 (b). Click iTunes, then iTunes store.
 (c). Click Purchases, Billing & Redemption, then continue
 (d). Click How to recover missing purchased items then continue
(e). Fill out everything BUT order number and item name then continue
(f). Don't sign in, just click continue again
(g). Click email, say that your hardrive got wiped due to a virus or something.


Now sometimes they might just make you redownload what you lost, or they will give you download credits! Just use the download credits on other stuff!
