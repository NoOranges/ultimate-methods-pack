Hello, this is another SE TUT by Prime.

So you are going to want to go over to http://www.gillette.com/language/index.html and pick your country ect.

The cool thing about this method is that it does not matter which razor that you try to SE they will send you a coupon (or coupons ;) ) for ANY razor if you do the method correctly. 

So first you are going to want to email Gillette's support right here http://www.gillette.com/en/us/home/contactus.aspx.

Say something along the lines of that you bought about 14-15 of them for some family members but it turned out that 3-4 were not working. for not working make up your own excuse I will not spoonfeed you. 

Well good luck to all of you that try this and as always 
ENJOY AstroPID :D
