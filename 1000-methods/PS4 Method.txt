Felt bad for not contributing for a while...so here's this. Pretty damn easy.
Oh, and to clarify things, PLAYSTATION HAS NEVER, GIVEN ARs, YOU HAVE TO BOX THEM. STOP CLAIMING THEY GIVE ARs...


METHOD ONE IS FOR CONSOLE ONLY(which has been tested and works)

Go on ebay and find a serial for a PS4 
(shouldn't be too hard. People on there stupidly put pics of the serial)

Call up Sony, tell them it wont power on. Go through their TS, and get them to setup a repair. (This will be a lot easier if you currently have a PS account, so it wont seem as suspicious)

Wait for you box. Box them with whatever you like. They don't check the weight.

IMPORTANT: They do require a receipt copy, but just do a best buy one for Nov. 15th. They don't verify. You will also recieve a pink peice of paper that can be ripped off: fill that out with your SR# and make sure you put correct info and all that. Put BOTH THE PAPER AND RECEIPT COPY IN BOX.

Have FedEx pick it up, or drop it off somewhere.

Call them up every now and then, checking in on the status. Mine took about 2 1/2 weeks because I did it the week of Thanksgiving. Yours shouldn't take longer than a week. 

Method 2 for FULL PS4 BUNDLE 
(not tested...was willing to spend the money for controller and mic)


All you have to do is say nothing is responding. Not you controllers, your console. Make it seem like that shit came defective as fuck. Say your controllers dont even work on another system that your friend has. Your console wont turn on, and your PS4 mic wont put out sound. EVERYTHING IN YOUR BUNDLE IS FUCKED. 

Continue with other part of method one after they setup repair.


Better not see a service out of this...really doubt anyone is going to box that many PS4s anyway.. :not_ripe:
