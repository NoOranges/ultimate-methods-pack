Swissvax offers a 100% money back no question asked guarantee. I actually ran into this by accident. In all reality I just wanted to SE some decent car shampoo but I received a reply talking about I will get my money back lol. 

They offer car supplies such as car shampoo, wax, detailer, etc. And yes I know you're like "Check for a shampoo... that can only be like $15", but you're wrong their highest price is about $1000 (PoP is most likely going to be needed for that much of an amount), but they also have nice prices ranging from $50-$200. I complaint about one of their $150 items (decent amount).

I complaint about one of their shampoos so I can't say it will work for another product but it should as the company offers money back not that single product. 

Steps:

1. I will first recommend going to Amazon and searching for a Swivaxx product you want (/get a check for). That way if you're asked for PoP you can just generate an Amazon receipt for an item they actually sell.

2. Head over to Swivaxx's official website and contact their customer support. 

3. Once you're in there support form (here) fill out your information. Use yours or someones real name so that you can check the check. If you're going to SE them more than once I will recommend using a different address, email, name, etc (you all should know how it works). 

For the inquiry I choose 'general'. 

In the box I just wrote how I was very disappointed with their product and how it wasn't washing my car, etc. Don't make the mistake I made and say it kind of ruined your car paint as they will want you to send it in. If for some reasons they ask you do send it in... well you should all know what to do. But just incase... Tell them it spilled somehow, or you threw it away because you were so disappointed, etc. 

4. Wait for a responds. It should only take a day or two and he will let you know how he is sorry that you were unsatisfied with their product, and that they offer a money back.... etc. 

Now you will either be told you're going to get a check or that you have to send yours in for inspection (you shouldn't have to if you just say it wasn't doing what you were told, etc.) in which case come up for a reason as to why you can't send it in. 

WARNING: This will probably be saturated fast as it seems its only one person is working these issues. I say this because in the email I received he said he was sorry for the delay but it was due to him being out of town. So that made me assume the this is the only guy because if he was out of town couldn't someone else who was in just reply. Either way enjoy!
