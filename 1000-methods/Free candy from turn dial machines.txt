I know I'm not the only one who hates only getting like 1 gumball per quarter...So, cheat these bitches for free candy.

You're gonna need a few things:

1. A quarter (or however much it costs, nickel, dime, etc)
2. Super Glue

Alright, so what you're gonna need to do is find one of the vending machines where you put the quarter in, turn the dial and get the candy.
Next, put some super glue in a ring midway between the edge and the center.
Quickly put the coin in and wait for the glue to dry (dries pretty quick, but give it 30 seconds).
Turn it as much as you want! Make sure the flap door doesn't open so you don't waste candy :monkey:
