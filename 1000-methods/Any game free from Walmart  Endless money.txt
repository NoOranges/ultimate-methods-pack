My example in this will be using an xbox 360 game, though it works with almost any disc-game.

Step 1
Purchase something of this sort
http://www.amazon.com/Empty-Standard-360-Translucent-Replacement-DVBR14XBOX/dp/B003A0QCTU/ref=sr_1_15?ie=UTF8&qid=1352691048&sr=8-15&keywords=xbox+360+case
or simply use an old xbox 360 case from a game you do not play.

Step 2
Purchase the game you want from Walmart

Step 3
Make a copy of the game's cover in the highest resolution you can, or find a high quality copy on the internet. Print this out and make sure to cut it precisely to the size of the original

Step 4
Purchase something of this sort.
http://www.walmart.com/ip/Avery-6692-Matte-White-CD-Labels-for-Color-Laser-Printers-and-Copiers-90-Labels-Pack/10353078
Follow the directions and print the label and attach it to a blank disc, or an old Xbox 360 game you don't play any more. Make sure you line it up perfectly, but if you are off by a bit, they usually will not notice

Step 5
Package everything together and drive back to the Walmart with your disc. There are two ways you can do it from here, simply give them the receipt for the refund, or my personal favorite. Tell them the disc didn't work/gave an error. They will scan the back (copy) and walk to the back and get a brand new copy of the game and give it to you. 

Step 6
Take the game home, sell it, rinse repeat. 

Most of the time the customer service agents don't know anything about any sort of technology, obviously avoid the smarter younger looking ones. The best are the older black ladies, look for those. Obviously make sure you don't do it to the same reps. If they for some reason find out its counterfeit, insist that this was how you bought the game. You can't get blamed.

Enjoy! PM me with questions
