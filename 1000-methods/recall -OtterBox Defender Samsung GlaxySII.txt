Okay, back into astro a few might remember me, a few might not.

THIS IS FOR THE S3!!
Well I was speaking to my mate the other day and he told me about how he bought a
Samaung galaxy S3 for himself and his son. He told me how he got his otterbox defender when they first came out
and only just got his sons which was a few months later.
He noticed that they were made out of different a completely different material and his was softer and starting to not create a god seal
anymore.

I know how silicone and plastics are made as its very basic chemistry and in a controlled industrial situation
there is no way that a batch would change that much and pass quality control.


They are basically handing them out without any need for P.O.P I've had my share so have fun.

I never needed P.O.P for any.


Well that'll be saturated soon,

peace
