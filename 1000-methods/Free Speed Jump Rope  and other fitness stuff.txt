Step 1.) Go to gofit.net and find the product you want (I did a speed jump rope).
Step 2.) Go to there contact us page (http://www.gofit.net/contact-gofit.php) and make up some problem with your product. For the jump rope I said I used it for two weeks and during use I tripped on it and it snapped. You will obviously need a different story if you're trying to get something other than a jump rope.
Step 3.) They asked for a picture of the problem, not sure if they always ask. Anyway, I just google searched "snapped jump rope" and literally the first result gave me a picture of a broken jump rope that looked exactly like the one I was trying to get.
Step 4.) Give them your shipping info and enjoy!
