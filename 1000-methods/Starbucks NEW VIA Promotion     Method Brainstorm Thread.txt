Hey all, being a university student I sure have a thing for coffee, and I am sure a lot of you do as well. 

I have a strong feeling that methods can be created to take advantage of Starbucks' latest promotion saying that if you purchase their VIA product, (only certain sizes/packs are "valid for this offer") and find it to be unsatisfactory, they will send you a complimentary 12oz bag of their regular ground coffee so I wanted to throw it on here for you all to see and hopefully benefit from.

May I also add, let's all work together on this, if you find something out about this, post it in this thread so that we can all learn from it and help eachother out... that is the whole point of this forum of course, and I want to see this community thrive and work together like it has been a lot more recently. I'm happy to see that occur, and would love for it to continue as much as possible!




My first impressions for methods/approaches that could be used (untested...):



A. A simple receipt Photoshop as far as I can see, and then pleading ignorance/laziness by printing out a blatant picture of the edited receipt in your hand, saying that you didn't know they wanted the exact receipt back, and that a picture of it would be sufficient enough... or else even trying to email it to them instead of sending it in, mentioning some excuse that there isn't any possible way for you to mail it in, so you "scanned it" and then emailed it instead...

NOTE: 
If you send it to their support/customer care email, it can easily be forwarded by them to a manager or someone who will definitely pass it  (It isn't worth them losing their hair over, and a potential customer)
-----------------------------
B. I have a feeling that if you called up Starbucks' phone line and mentioned to them that "I heard about this promotion, and decided to try out the VIA product, however it was <insert complaint here> (not worth the money, overpowered, had tiny grounds in it, made you sick) so you wanted to follow through on their guarantee for a bag of coffee, however you were so enraged/pissed off and since you didn't even finish the entire drink, you threw away the coffee and receipt that were both in your hand, NOT KNOWING that it was needed for the offer.

I am quite sure it will be unlikely that they will deny your claim, since they are very lenient with customers, as they don't want to lose support by 1. Bad tasting product, and 2. Bad reputation for an "unclear promotion"/not following through on it. 




I will leave it up to you guys on here to do whatever you can with this... I don't know if my suggested method to go about it will work or not, as I have not personally attempted it yet, but I have a feeling this will be easily manageable for SE, and that we will definitely end up deriving some sort of method for this by the time people start to try and tackle it!


Thanks for looking, and I hope you appreciate my time and effort throwing this together along with the sexy formatting on this thread lol. Let's all work together and get our coffee fixes on!
