I have done this for my dad and he  his pc was i5 core they gave him i7 :P

1. get a service tag from craigslist or eBay
2. check the warranty and transfer it into your name.
3.call dell and say your laptop was not turning on and your powering the systems
4. tell then you just got this laptop from some guy on craigslist and you don't remember his name but he transferred it.
5. they will try to help you fix the problem just keep saying nothing happening when you do it.
6.they will start doing rma and saying your going have to send it back. say " well i was using the laptop few months ago when and i had cut my finger on the side if the laptop and i have a skin problem that i never heard of and i not allowed to send stuff due to doctor.
IF the ask for a doctor note say that is not possible the doctor u had before is no longer a doctor.
7. if your lucky u will get a cool manager that up go head ans gave you a new laptop and tell you trash the old 1 


If you need pics send me a pm
