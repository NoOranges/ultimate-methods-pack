I know theres a bunch of niggaz who play war thunder here @Bosnian  and I just wanted to share this method with you guys for getting free Lions... beware this is easily saturated due to the size of their customer support team so better do it fast :P


1. Attempt to make a purchase using an empty vcc

2. Contact support say the website froze and you never got your wolves/lions

3. They will ask for proof of purchase... Just show them the CC statement that never went through and make it look like it did.

4. Complain

5. Get lions/wolves

6. Thank me for putting this in vip
