Step 1 – Create a new steam account (or use an existing one)
Step 2 – Use my PSD and edit the text to a random serial (EA Serials are 20 digit, just google a bit how they look like for the game)
Step 3 - Make a new Support Ticket (Here)
Like this:

Make a text, saying its not working, be creative
Step 4 - Wait for them to respond, they will ask you for PoP, just send them your pic;)
Step 5 - Enjoy your free game!
