BEWARE
" shipment has been delayed due to low inventory." I'd chill with this for a bit lol

I recommend doing different HDDs





I am aware this method has been talked about here and there, yet no detailed official method has been released.

This is for VIP methods, do not move it to contributor/elite.

I will also include the serial algorithm for the most expensive drives, the Seagate Cheetah drives ranging up to $500, unfortunately they do not sell any SSD's so we can't get those.

It will require
- Serial
- VCC

Serial Algorithm for Cheetah Drives 600GB 15000RPM
- 6SL3YQXX - Replace XX with numbers
Model Number: 9FN066-008
This only works in the United States - That will only provide 99 serial numbers, if anyone wants to work on the rest of the algo feel free.

Working VCCs
- Powerfuls VCCs do not work - the same source as SlimSt
- Entropay VCCs do not work.
- SlimSt VCCs do not work - the same source as Powerful
- Arbiters are said to work I dunno?
- Other prepaid cards are not tested
- Greendot VCCs work
