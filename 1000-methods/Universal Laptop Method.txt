This is my laptop method I used to get my toshiba. Once you have a serial/tag call up the company and say this:
"Hi, I have been an avid user of your laptops for years. I have been using your laptops for my buisness even! So last night, I left my (insert laptop here) on to download some work files. In the morning, the laptop would not turn on what so ever. I tried removing the battery, (bs your troubleshooting steps here.) POINT AND CASE: It doesn't work.

Now, they should say: "It seems you are in need of a mail-in replacement/repair."

Tell them: "I would love that but I can't since I work for the county and all of my work files are on there."

(If you are doing this on Dell, they may ask you to take the drives out. Tell them that's a hasell and you can't do that...you know the drill. Act upset.)

They will either cave and order the replacement, or transfer to a supervisor. If they say the bullshit "Unfortunately our policy does not allow...blahblahblah." Tell them you want a supervisor. When you get him/her act upset and angry about it. They should now create a replacement order for you.

This is confirmed working with Toshiba.
