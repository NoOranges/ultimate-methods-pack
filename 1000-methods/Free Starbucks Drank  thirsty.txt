1. Order your drink at starbucks.


2. Make sure that they start your drink (kinda, they don't need to exactly start your drink).


3. Use a debit card that WILL FOR SURE be declined. You can use your own if you want, just hit up your bank and freeze assets.


4. They swipe your card and tell you it doesn't work


5. Say you don't have cash and that the card worked this morning.


6. Get free drank.
