Say you have an issue with your earphones. Be creative, it's not hard to come up with an excuse for them to replace.
Once they say they need replacing, typically they insist on the earphones being returned, as UE uses different returns policy to Logitech.
This is the difficult part of the SE, and may take several tries - ask to be transferred to a supervisor. You need to persuade them to ship you the earphones without you returning the old ones. I've had no trouble doing this using multiple excuses so it can't be too difficult, but obviously this will depend on your

Wait 3 days for shipping, enjoy your brand new earphones!




This could potentially work for the TripleFi 10 earphones too, but those have a visible PID on them so they're harder. Working on a method for those too.
It is a bit hit-and-miss, so repeat until it works.
