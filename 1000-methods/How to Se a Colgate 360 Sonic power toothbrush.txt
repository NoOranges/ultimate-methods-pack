Firstly go to the Colgate's contact page: http://www.colgate.com.au/app/Colgate/AU/Corp/ContactUs.cvsp
Then call them up or email (calling them you will get a replacement straight) and say that you sonic 360 toothbrush stopped working after a week, the representative will ask for a serial number on the head of the brush, say you cant find it. he will then ask for your name, info, address etc, to replace the toothbrush,

Next enjoy brushing your teeth with a $40 toothbrush,

It should work on all of their items.
