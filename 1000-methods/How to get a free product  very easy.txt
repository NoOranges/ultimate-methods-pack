1. First we'll begin to go into the store, pick the product you want, when you've picked it, go and purchase it.
2. When you've purchase the item, remember to keep the reciept and go out from the store, here you'll leave the product outside (to a friend or something)
3. go into the store once again and take the same product again and go to the "checkout", tell them you're regretting buying this and they will probably remember you because you were there a few min ago, they'll see it's not even open and they will give you your money back.

Now you've got the money back and you're friend outside the store holding the product.

Reminder: Remember that this have to be a store where you cannot walk to the checkout directly. Also the second time you take the product try to hide when you're taking it so
