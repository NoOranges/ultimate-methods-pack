Somedays we all sit back and think to our selves, "I wish I had a sharper pencil." Today is your lucky day AstroPID because now you can SE X-Acto for the finest in pencil sharpening equipment.

Requirements:
- Serial (maybe)
- Receipt for Amazon
- This Method :D

So start with emailing, or calling X-Acto here: http://www.xacto.com/contact-us.aspx

Give them an excuse for how your sharpener will not turn on or you put a pencil in and it made a very loud noise before it stopped working. (NOTE: this is a method for the pencil sharpeners, not the knives or other products that they offer but with a good excuse I am sure that those are easy too.)

They will email you back or say that they are sorry for the defect and would like to see the serial (maybe) and the proof of purchase.

Give them what they want and your address and in about two weeks time you will have a sharpener at your house or drop. I got lucky when I performed this SE because they screwed up and sent me two instead of one.

Good Luck AstroPID
