This shit is so simple.. I don't know why you niggers aren't raping it right now but w/e
Basically you need a S/N of the laptop you want..
Call samsung make up a problem with your laptop...
Rage at them if you want.. tell them you got an important meeting to go to or w/e you wanna say to them..
If they ask you to send back the laptop tell them that you can't because you're going away for 1 week and you need the laptop repair as soon as as possible.. If they offer advance replacement to you good.. 
If they don't then just box method them.. you might need a receipt not 100% sure about it.. 
but you can always PM someone on ebay, craiglist or a friend of yours for a receipt..
Done

I don't know why I haven't seen anyone post this shit before.. but here yo go...
