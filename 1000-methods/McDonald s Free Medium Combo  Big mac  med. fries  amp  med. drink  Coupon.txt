Hey Guys (and gals) 
I know its not hard to SE fast-food, especially McDonald's, but I've got a method (Coupon) that will give you a free meal. Its great for road trips, or even you're local McDonald's, but I wouldn't do it too many times there. I don't want to completely saturate this to the point of where corp. learns about it, so PM me, and I'll attach the coupon (Sheet of 8), there perfect to print out and save in you're wallet next time you're outta money and want a little snack. 

When you hand the cashier the coupon they are usually a little confused, and after reading it, they might give you a funny look or call the manager, no worries. Just say your mom/dad/girlfriend/boyfriend/significent other did a survey online and got this free coupon and they asked you to run to McDonald's to grab yourself some lunch. 

I've done this a few times at my local McDonald's and never had a problem. Had the manager look at it once, but he didn't say anything other then "where'd you get this" 
Although the Mexican's working at the downtown McDonald's in Chicago told me McDonald's doesn't accept coupons, so I went down the block and tried it at another one.

Not much of a contribution, but heh, its something.
So PM me and I'll send you the coupon.

P.S. Just remembered I have a Wendy's one too, I've never tried it, but if you want it, its yours. Just send me a PM

Another Edit:  I'm getting to many PM's and I think it won't be too saturated if I just post a link to it, so

I will be taking it down in 24-48 hours though. So Save it to you're computer!
