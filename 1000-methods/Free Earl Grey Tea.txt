Summary: 

Ran out of tea one afternoon so I decided to contact Twining for free tea. It only took one email and I received the tea coupon and some samples.

Method:


1. Email consumer.service@twiningsusa.com


This is what I wrote:
I purchased your English Breakfast tea and I was very disappointed. It is very very weak, I had to use two bags to make a drinkable cup of tea. It tastes like Lipton tea which blows! I spent $30 on the Amazon 6 pack box and had to throw it away. I bought your earl gray and it was amazing! Please do something to improve this tea.


Sincerely,
NAME
ADDRESS


I just included my address in the first email to them. That is pretty much it. If you're a fan of tea why not get some for free?


Received: 3 samples of tea + Coupon for a free pack of 20ct tea.
