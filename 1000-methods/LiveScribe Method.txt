Hello, new to the community. Haven't seen this anywhere so, here's my first contribution.


For this product, all you will need is a receipt. I have found that they did not check my amazon generated receipt, but I still will recommend to make a Walmart receipt.


This products serial number can only be checked by turning on the Livescribe Pen, or from the packaging. 


1. Go call, email, or chat Livescribe
2. Say your Pen will not turn on
3. They will ask you for serial number (By turning on the pen or from packaging)
4. Say you threw away the packaging
5. They will ask you for proof of purchase
6. Give it to them
7. If all goes well, they send a replacement out with a prepaid label for a return after asking for your address.
8. Be specific and say you want the USB cable replaced too

I tried to make some shit up for the notebook, but they wanted pictures for that. You pretty much need the notebook to do anything (Buy it from amazon or try to SE it I guess)
