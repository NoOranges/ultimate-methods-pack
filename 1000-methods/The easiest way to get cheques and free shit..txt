Basically, we are targeting small business's.
I know many people have moral dilemmas about this and if you do then this method is not for you.
The success rate is crazy, 4 out of 5 emails resulted in either cheques or replacements.
Try to find if they sell at a market or something, it makes the process alot easier.

Here is an example of what i've sent; it really doesn't need to be complex, however they will in most cases ask where it was bought from etc.  It's really quite basic.

Hi, recently a close friend of mine bought me some of your Chai.  I
had everything read to make myself and her some lovely chai tea,  and
when i opened the packet there was only a really small amount in
 there.It was a 100g bag, i weighed it again and there was only 32g.
 It was sealed and everything.  Very disappointed customer.

Step A) Find your target product, for me it was Chai as i love Chai.

Step B) Simply Google your state and target item.  IE: For me it would be, Australian Chai.

Step C) Go to their websites and email them.

Step D) Use an excuse that suits your product.  IE: The chai was really dry and tasted extremely sour, purchased from a local market etc etc.

Step E) Wait for a reply, and in most cases enjoy your shit.

Results.
