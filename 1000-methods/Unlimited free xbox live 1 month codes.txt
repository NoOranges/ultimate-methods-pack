I HAVE SEEN MAY GUYS ASKING ABOUT MS POINTS 

1. Make a new gamertag on xbox.com

2. Go to Live chat

3. Say 'I recently purchased a new Xbox and I was just creating a new account and it stated that I had to put my credit card in, my card doesn't allow me to use online'

4. They will say that it's there policy that you have to put your details in.

5. Say 'On the box when I purchased my Xbox it didn't state that I have to use your card and therefore this is false advertisement about the free 1 month trial.'

6. They will say no, it is against their policies

7. Say you want to speak to a supervisor

8. Tell the supervisor the same story as above and ask if they will be able to offer a code over the phone. If they say they are able to offer a code over the phone then get a reference number and call up xbox support and say a colleague could you they would issue a code over the phone and give them your reference.

9. If they don't give you a code, Keep mentioning the fact that its false advertisement as it doesn't say that you have to use a credit card on the box and that you were told you could have a code over the phone.

10. If they refuse, ask to speak to a supervisor

11. They will send you a code via email to the email of the account you made

NOTE  : THIS THING WORKS SAME WITH WINDOWS KEYS ALSO 

IF ITS OLD OR ANYTHING WRONG WITH THIS PLX IGNORE THIS
