I'm trying to SE that item from Philips because it seriously fucking hurt to shave with a razor.. I'm broke like everyone else tho :/

Anyway, I failed SE'ing Philips in the past, I know, people say it's easy and I know there will be at least one person posting in this thread saying 'Philips is sooooooooooo easy!!!!1111' but seriously it isn't.

If anyone could help me, I really need that damn shaving device, I'd really appreciate.
