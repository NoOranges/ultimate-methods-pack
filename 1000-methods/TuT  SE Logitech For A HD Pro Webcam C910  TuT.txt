Welcome to my tutorial on how to SE Logitech for a HD Webcam Pro C910

First of all generate a PID with the program or use one of your own if you have one. Then open notepad, then copy & paste the PID there for later. Now we need to get the model number which can be found here:

http://www.amazon.co.uk/Logitech-HD-Pro-Webcam-C910/dp/B003SDDR7Y/ref=sr_1_2?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1321373965&sr=1-2

Then we will need a receipt, you can use amazon receipt generator for this. So go ahead and generate a receipt.
NOTE: MAKE SURE YOU GO BACK AT LEAST ONE MONTH FROM TODAY'S DATE! ! !

Now we have a PID, M/N, P/N & an generated amazon receipt. So now you can head over here:
http://logitech-en-emea.custhelp.com/app/ask

Make an account if you need to, then enter the info requested and come up with a good reason as to why your webcam is faulty and needs replacing. 

You should then recieve an email like this: 236

Just reply with the requested data. Then the next email should be something like this 237

Just reply with you information once again then they will email you this: 238

:D Profit!!!
