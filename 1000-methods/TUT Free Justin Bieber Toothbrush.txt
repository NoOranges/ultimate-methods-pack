Hello 
I apologize for the inconvenience. We will go ahead and replace the defective brush for you. Could you please tell me where the batteries are located? Are they in the front of the handle or do they slip in through the side? Could you please forward your shipping address and let me know what songs your  brush sings. Thank you so  much for your understanding and patience.
