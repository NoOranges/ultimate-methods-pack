Just do a normal call-in for an iphone 4, and they should ask you if a 4S will suffice.

Dear Bob,

Thank you for contacting AppleCare.

Recently a product replacement was created under case ID --------, for serial number 8--------.  I will be tracking this replacement and keeping you informed via email as the process continues.

I was unable to reach you on the phone at your listed phone number. I would like to confirm the following information so I can process your order (for privacy/security reasons, I am unable to provide the shipping address that we have for you).

We are unable to ship the phone initially offered by Brian and we can upgrade your phone, however the new phone will take at least 1-2 weeks to ship. Please respond with your shipping address and confirm that you agree with the new configuration of the replacement product. The configuration we can offer is:

IPHONE 4S BLACK 32GB

If you have any questions regarding this process, please email me (samina@apple.com) with your case ID (--------) and I will reply within one business day.

Kind regards,
--------- ---------
