Well if you do not have golden toes read this to learn how to get them.

Golden toes are socks which are unbelievably comfortable and are easy as tits to SE. 

To start off the SE you are going to head on over to  http://www.goldtoe.com/ and browse the site for something that interests you. They sell socks, underwear and many other things, all of which are very comfortable.

After you know what you want you have to contact those niqqas here http://www.goldtoe.com/pages/Contact-Us.html or they will never even know about your "problem".

Start of by saying hello yadayada I recently bought your socks and they : smelled like shit : had a rip in them : stain on the sock : ect.

They might ask for a receipt but prolly will not and most of the time they will just ask for your address and be on your merry way. 

I hope you all enjoyed this method and now your feet can be nice and toasty this winter. :D
