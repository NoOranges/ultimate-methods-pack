Preface: This method/tutorial has been described as "immoral", though what SE actually is? If you're easily offended by things of an immoral nature, please stop reading now.

This SE is probably different than anything you've done, it isn't a product or service. This SE involves making a fundraising campaign on a website called Indiegogo.

Indiegogo is a crowd funding website similar to kickstarter. People create posts that name their organization/goal and what is needed from the people. Indiegogo has a large user base, so thousands of people see the posts.

When making a post on indiegogo, you have to state your goal. For instance, researching the cause of autism in babies. After choosing your topic, you'll have to make a convincing story about why you need money and what the donators get in return. I've personally done this before, (Won't give the name of course) and this part is very important. For example, you could say something like "My organization's goal is to research the cause of Autism in Babies. Hopefully with your funding, we'll be able to identify and cure autism in the infant stage. Donators will receive a signed, numbered and framed token of our appreciation" 

Money earned from your Indiegogo campaign goes straight into your paypal account, no strings attached. (People may be able to charge back, hasn't happened to me yet)
