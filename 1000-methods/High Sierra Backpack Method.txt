Haven't posted in a while and have been saving this for around school start time.  Pretty simple.  Actually happened to me.


1. Email High Sierra support pretending to be some concerned mom or dad.  Complain about child's backpack ripping already into the school year.  Talk about how you have been a dedicated High Sierra backpack buyer or some other bullshit then say how this have never happened before.

2. They should now say how sorry they are and ask for a picture.  This is VIP I'm sure we all know how to get around pictures.  Photoshop and Google are always helpful as well as saying you dont have a camera.

3. profit?
