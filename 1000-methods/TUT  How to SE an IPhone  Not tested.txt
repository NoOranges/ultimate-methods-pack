This method I found on my computer so credits to whoever made it not going to be bothered to test it I just make money off BF3, Microsoft, Fileice, and Duracell


Step 1:

So what you are going to need to do is grab yourself a PID of the product you want, either from a generator such as the astropid generator, or by SE&#8217;ing one from an online shop such as eBay.com.

Step 2:

Now that you have your PID, let&#8217;s move on to the hardest part.
&#8226; US : iPod, Mac and iPad technical support: (800) APL-CARE (800-275-2273)
&#8226; US : iPhone technical support: (800) MY-IPHONE (800-694-7466)
&#8226; UK : 0844 209 0611 &#8226; France : 0805 540 003

Ok, find the number that corresponds to your country (notice I&#8217;ve even given you the numbers in a different colour? Some advanced stuff right?) and give them a call.

Here&#8217;s the bit that nobody else is doing or even telling you&#8230;
They are going to say the normal (good day this is Apple blah blah&#8230;) and you say something about being transferred from another customer rep (&#8220;Ah it&#8217;s about time I&#8217;ve been transferred, hello&#8221;) and explain to them that you have been on the phone for 45 minutes or so now and you was told by the representative before that he would transfer you to another rep that will process the replacement. 

He/she may ask for a reference number, but tell them that you didn&#8217;t get one, or you forgot it, use your imagination!

So now, he/she will ask the problem, so sound annoyed and &#8216;repeat what you told the other rep&#8217; and she may ask youfor a serial/IMEI so have that ready.

He/she may tell you that you have to send back your old product, in which case use the box method. If not, they may ask you for CC details to process the replacement, and tell her that you already gave them to the person before and you don&#8217;t want to give them out again

(lame I know, obviously work your own charm here) and with any luck, you will have your application for a brand new iPod/iPhone accepted and it will be on it&#8217;s way to you!
