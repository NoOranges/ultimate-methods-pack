Since I stopped selling this, I thought I would share the method, these are so simple to do, all depends on the rep.

What you need
- Serial
- Time for indian support reps

Serial Bases - Replace the XXXX with 4 random numbers
Roku 2 XS - 13A17G00XXXX
Roku XD: J0A15J00XXXX
Roku LT: 1DC21900XXXX
Roku 2 XD: 12A18813XXXX



1. Go to support.roku.com - and click live chat, alternately call this number free: 1-888-600-7658

2. Tell them one of a few problems
- Roku doesn't turn on
- Repeatedly cuts out
- Acid leakage from inside, of sticky stuff, you don't want to touch etc..
- Make sure you say you purchased it within 90 days

3. Reps will go through troubleshooting

4. Some reps will fuck you over and tell you send it back, some will just offer straight replacement

5. Once you receive your roku they ask you to send it back, simply say your mum through it out once you receive they will make a "exception" for you and enjoy.
