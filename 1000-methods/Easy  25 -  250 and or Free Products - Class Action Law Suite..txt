Hydroxycut has been sued and its customers are due a settlement.

For each product you claim, they'll send you $25 or a product bundle (includes 2 hydroxycut products).
If you only claim one item, you will not need a receipt, they will send you the $25 or the bundle without any proof of purchase.

You can claim up to 10 products, meaning $250 or 10 product bundles ( 2 products per bundle ), however, for multiple products you will need receipt(s), which can be easily gotten.

This is for purchases between 5/9/06 - 5/1/09 so no your receipts, be sure to have the correct dates.
