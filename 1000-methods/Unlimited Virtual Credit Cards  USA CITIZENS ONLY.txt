Self introduction:

Call me Chase, I am from United States, and been doing this "social engineering" thing for about 2 years now. Not the type to brag or leak or even share information unless you seem like a genuine person who is actually motivated, realistic, and somewhat intelligent.

Requirements for this Virtual Credit Card:

1. Legitimate information
2. Be able to apply for a credit card
3. Actually pay off any debt you spend on the card
4. Get approved for the credit card

How this works:

1. go to a bank of america office or go to bankofamerica.com
2. apply for their credit card
3. once you are approved for the credit card, you will be able to generate unlimited amounts of card numbers

Pros of BOA generated cards:

1. You can add expiration date
2. You can add a card limit ($2 minimum, credit limit maximum)
3. Unlimited amount of credit card numbers
4. 100% valid card numbers and works for almost everything: gamefly, netflix, ebay, paypal, google adword, facebook ad, and many many other trial places
5. Different billing names can charge through
6. INSTANT card number creation
7. Can file chargeback with credit card directly
8. too many more, explore it yourselves


Cons of BOA generated numbers:

1. they all start with the same 4 digits.
2. they are all linked to your actual credit card number (so if you loan someone else a vcc, they charge it, you get fucked)
3. they all share the same billing address
4. you have to pay the amount of money due if you fuck up
5. sometimes it can over charge the limit ($5 card limit, charge $9 will go through)

-Enjoy, and don't abuse or over leak this shit.
