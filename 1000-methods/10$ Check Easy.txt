2.Then fill out everything no need for a drop. 
In the message put something like:

"I recently purchased your spinbrush pro clean and when I was using it, the head of the toothbrush came off of the base in my mouth and chipped one of my tooth. This is very disappointing now since I spent over $1000 on my teeth for braces and now I have a chipped tooth. What can I do about this?"

3. PROFIT! They will not email you back, but instead mail you a $10 check made out to your name and something about sending in the product about two weeks later. You don't need to send anything back in, but they will call you asking about what happened just say that you are busy at school or what ever and tell them you will call them back. They will email you about 1 week later, and just reply with that your phone was turned off because you haven't paid your bill and your good.
