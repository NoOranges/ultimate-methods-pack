Step One  : Choose the pens you want from the staedler site

Step two : Compose an email to them at marketing@uk.staedtler.com - You know what to say in the email, the pen's don't work they were leaking and so on .

Step Three : They will contact you but make sure you have receipts ready they will ask for them.

Step Four : wait about a day and your pens  should come

Enjoy!

I got a 10 pack of pens from them so it definitely works
