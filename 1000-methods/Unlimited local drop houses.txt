What's needed: Alias, disguise(optional), a good story

Method:

Step 1): Your first step is to get your story straight and figure out what you are going to say to your victims.

Step 2): You are going to go for a walk around the neighborhood of your choice and pick a house with some friendly trustworthy looking people

Step 3): Approach the house and knock on the door, Tell the people that you just made an order from (Insert company name here) and you just moved in locally and you accidentally entered in the wrong address, The package is supposed to be here this week blah blah blah

Step 4) At this point you can either give these people a form of contact (phone,email, ect) or you could just tell them that you are going to be back 

Step) 4.1 Optional, you can show how grateful you are by offering money out of thanks but if you don't have it this isn't needed.
 
Step 5) If they agree to this continue an SE to this house or hell even card to the house and go get your items whenever available,

Step 6) Go pick up your items and have a jolly good time.


I understand that this is a basic method but I just figured I would post it anyways,
