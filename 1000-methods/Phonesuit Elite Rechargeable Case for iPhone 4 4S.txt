I did this SE a while back and believe it should still work. Will make this a fairly open tutorial as you all know the basics...or SHOULD know the basics. Contact them, make up a story, possibly ignore/box/or bio/etc., profit.



Step 1. Choose the product you want. In this case, I got this:
http://www.phonesuit.com/iphone-battery-case-phonesuit-elite-4

Step 2. Contact Support @ support@phonesuit.com
I just made up the story that it wouldn't charge my iPhone and I was going on a long term business trip soon and so couldn't return my old one. Even going as far as to say that I might not even receive the replacement in time. He still send me the return stickers along with the new case, but they never contacted me again.

Step 3. Profit?
Like I said, made this a simple as I could to hopefully prevent copy and paste SE members and to let you make up your own stories. If you can get out of returning the old product easily, then great.

If they send you the return stuff to return your nonexistent old case, then best to make a story beforehand to excuse yourself from sending it back anyway. That way if they contact you later for some reason, then you can say you OPENLY told them that you couldn't send it back anyway.

AND if you just wanna ignore the return stuff, then fine. They haven't contacted me AT ALL since I last emailed them. But don't blame me if something happens. Probably won't, but I'm not taking responsibility for what YOU do with this info.



Anyway, my first tutorial, hopefully you all don't saturate it too fast as they have some nice new products I've been eyeing. XD Hope it wasn't too bad, and I apologize for how short it is, but most companies are the same really, find product and requirements like serials, contact them, make up story, done.

Good luck. :)
