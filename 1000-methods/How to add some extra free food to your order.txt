This method works best (and mostly only) for snackbars where you can give your order through the phone, tell them when you'll go get it and pay on the spot.

Alright, so go get yourself such a snackbar. Phone em up and give them your order. Add one of the food that you'd like for free. Be sure to be there at the exact time that they said your order would be done. Once there, you tell the guy at the cash register you ordered through the phone (and give him an order number if one has been given to you). Now he will most likely repeat the order. Now tell him that there's one too much of something in the order. For example, if your order was 2 burgers and 1 fries, tell him that you only ordered 1 burger. Now your order should be just about done. If it's a small mistake of only 1 unit, they won't make a big deal out of it. Even more so during peak hours. Now if you've done this correctly and have some luck, you'll have 2 burgers and 1 fries while you only paid for 1 burger and 1 fries. Not really too efficient, but whatever. Method can't really be saturated unless you use it every day of every week.
