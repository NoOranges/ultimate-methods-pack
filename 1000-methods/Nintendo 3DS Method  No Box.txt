This method is fairly simple and only requires the following things:

1. A pretty basic but fundamentally sound SEing ability.
2. Prepaid CC 
3. Nintendo 3DS Serail

I also highly recommend getting: 

1. A dumby Email 
2. A Google Voice/Skype number 

Method:

Call Nintendo's support line (I don't feel like locating the number) and call them. When you get to an agent, tell them you are a little frustrated and upset because you're going on a trip next week but your 3DS has some kind of error and is not playable (use your imagination) and you just called a few minutes ago and the agent said he can offer some kind of fast replacement where they charge your credit card and they send you a 3DS first and you send your old one in the box it came in. The agent will go ahead and process the replacement. It ships very fast. The only thing to note is that nintendo will send you some harsh and stupid emails saying they really want the 3DS back but just ignore them as they don't do anything (I've SEd about 4 of these over the past several months).
