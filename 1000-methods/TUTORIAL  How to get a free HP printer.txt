This is my first tutorial, so bare with me if I leave any vital information out. However, I will go step-by-step as to how I get my OWN personal printer using this method. I haven't seen any printer methods on this site, nor any other website, so this is my own. Hopefully, it doesn't get leaked if anything, however, it is quite easy and is similar to the many other HP SE'ing tutorials.

HP Deskjet 3050A e-All-in-One Printer - J611g

First step: Submit your Request.
Visit http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/weInput?product=5061082&lc=en&cc=ca&dlc=en&tmp_weDest=https%3A%2F%2Fh10025.www1.hp.com%2Fewfrf%2Fwc%2Femail%3F&submitHUB.y=0&lang=en&submitHUB.x=0&cc=ca and enter your serial on the printer as well as the product number, then click submit. The product number is obtainable through the product's page. In this tutorial, we'll be doing the HP Deskjet 3050A e-All-in-One Printer - J611g. (As you can see below.)

Second Step: Fill out the required information.

SAMPLE INFO -
Please select your preferred language/country for technical support: English - United States
Select a problem area: Installation and Setup
When did you purchase your product?: October 2011
What is your serial number (SN)?: PM me for it.
What is your operating system?: Windows Vista Ultimate 32
How is your product connected to your PC? USB
If there is an error message, please specify?: N/A
Please provide the exact problem description: Be creative here. Describe how it doesn't when you plug it in, you have all the update drivers, you tried it on numerous other computers, etc. Mention that it was a gift to avoid a PoP request. However, in the case they request it, it is simple as 1-2-3 to generate one.
Please provide previous troubleshooting steps, or information that can help HP assist you.: N/A

You should then receive an email within 24 hours with a few troubleshooting techniques you can "try". Just reply stating that you've tried it, and your printer still doesn't work.

After that, you should get an email like such:
