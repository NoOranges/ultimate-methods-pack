Hey,
im sure most of you know the Netgear BETA Thread (You don't? Checkout http://astropid.com/forums/showthread.php?15937-Get-free-things-from-Netgear-Beta-Hardware). So I went ahead and searched for other Beta Centers from well known companies and found https://www.onlinebeta.com. OnlineBeta is owned by CenterCode, who developed Connect&#8482;, thats the same software NETGEAR uses and other companies. They offer various beta test from consumer electronics and common household items, to business and educational software. Just checkout http://www.centercode.com/clients . FYI: If you dont want to betatest Software just dont check it when you signup. 

So most(all?) of us just want to keep the items, if you can keep the item varies depending on each particular project, in most cases, you will have the opportunity to keep the products you tested. In other cases, companies may wish to evaluate the tested products so other incentives (often final boxed versions of the product) are offered. The incentive may be final products, gadgets, Amazon.com gift cards, and various other rewards. If you have to return the tested product, paperwork/prepaid label is already included with your originial shipment.


You will get an email when there is some new beta test opportunity and you can apply for ALL beta test opportunitys because most of them are from different companies.


Anyways just signup on https://www.onlinebeta.com, fill out your profile and wait for some beta projects to apply for.
