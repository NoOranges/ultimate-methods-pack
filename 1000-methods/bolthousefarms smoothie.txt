I love this stuff so I decided to SE them....

1. Contact them here http://www.bolthouse.com/ and scroll down to "contact us" and fill in info needed.

2. Bottle info you can get at any store that sells this or you can always Google. I chose the 52 oz of course and under "comments" any excuse will do. The one I used is very generic and in a day you'll get an email like this: http://gyazo.com/d2b651beaf214d18b8bb15ebca27c960

3. I already had a receipt where I bought one but, I got lazy and didn't shop the other 3 bottles.:p Plus I wanted to see if they send refund or coupons. Im getting a coupon but, they may do both depending and how much you spent.
