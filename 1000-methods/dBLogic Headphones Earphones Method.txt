NOTE: This method now requires PoP and box method. dBLogic has caught on. I have updated the thread to suit the new requirements.

*This method was tested in Canada

This is an extremely easy method (if you can even call it that) to receive a pair of dBLogic headphones or earphones. Personally I did this with the HP100 headphones (they sell for more), but I'm sure the same steps apply for their earphones.

Step 1: Pick a headset or earphone product from http://www.dblogic.com/

Step 2: Contact them via email here http://www.dblogic.com/html/contact.html (Phoning in may work, but I haven't tested it)

Step 3: Say that you have had your headphones/earphones for X amount of weeks and you've always treated them properly, and today when you went to use them there was a very loud crackling noise in the headphones. Say you've tested it on multiple computers and you checked the wire and it was fine. Ask what you can do about this situation. Try to change this up due to them changing policies.

Step 4: They will contact you back asking for PoP and will need you to ship the item in.

Step 5: Use box method.

Congratulations, you're the proud new owner of dBlogic headphones/earphones.
