Ladies love mystical bullshit
And they love holding hands
And they love learning new things
And they love Chai tea

I do this all the time to network new drops/ladyminxes, just hang out in a coffeeshop until you notice a girl sitting alone reading something shitty, looking at you, or sitting without her headphones on(but present), none of those girls want to be alone.  
Approach them with a twinkle eye smile and explain that for your "Holistic Living"(or some hippy BS) class you just learned to read palms and would love the chance to practice with her.  
Now you just hold her hand, look into her eyes, and explain that her hand says she's a smart beautiful woman who radiates a special joy to all who share her company.  
Early on say one line just ended recently and ask what big thing just happened to her so you can "get your bearings".  Talk and chat as much as possible so you can learn exactly what she wants to hear but whenever the conversation drags grip her hand, look at it, and tell her something amazing out herself.  
After about twoish hours(when she laughs at everything and has a blush) of holding hands and being told how compatible your hands are(be subtle) be thrilled and explain that her love line is equal to her "whatever line was represented something big that just happened to her" which means she's about to meet someone amazingly special any moment.  Now squeeze her hand while doing eye twinkle smile and if she squeezes back invite her somewhere private or just grin, say all this talking made your lips are dry, and kiss her.  If she doesn't then do better.

For PUA types this keeps her in secure public state as long as SHE wants, ups you rapport instantly by catering to her beliefs, earns you instant kino that you can keep up as long as you want, and allows you to say ANYTHING to increase her buying temp thanks to the spirituality.

No need to use a box, but I always suggest a condom.
