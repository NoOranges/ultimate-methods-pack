Basically, just normally buy and download Mountain Lion or Lion, and then like a few days later, call Apple Support, and tell them that while you were installing your OS, it had corrupted your hard drive and you had to take it to the Genius Bar to get it fixed; but that you would like to get a refund for Mountain Lion/Lion since it had never actually installed onto the computer.

Of course, this just requires an initial investment of 20$, and that you give them the apple id of the account you bought it on. Discovered this method because this happened to me. They were able to refund it despite their no-refund policy, and with no questions asked.
