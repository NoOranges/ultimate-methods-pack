To be honest I don't even know why did I SE'd this, but OK. It worked so someone might find it useful. I already said jmd about this stuff.

I saw this on Amazon while I searched for totally other stuff, but with the similar name. So they were easy, at least when I did them.

Site is brizo.com but their email address is from deltafaucet.com

Also I did it for faucet similar to this one, but I can't find it now on amazon for some reason.
 http://www.amazon.com/Brizo-63920LF-SS-Single-Pull-Down-Stainless/dp/B004LYAO7A/ref=pd_sim_sbs_hi_6

1. Head over to Amazon and search for Brizo (you can try on their deltafaucet.com site but it's somehow confusing) and pick what you want to SE.

2. go to their web site that I provided in step 1 and go to contact us.

3. Send some excuse for your product.

4. After sorry and other usual stuff, they will ask for receipt (at least they asked me) and picture of faucet (said wife threw it)

5. Astroproof for amazon works

6. When receipt pass through they will send some .pdf file and ask you to name which parts you need. Just say you need whole faucet obviously.

And that's it.
