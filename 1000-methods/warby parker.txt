warby parker has a home try on program that lets you try on frames and sun glasses for free. all you need is a vcc with $1 and pick the glasses you want sent out to you.

theres no explaining needed, just search in google "warby parker home try on"
i will not link to the website since people will just click strait onto the link etc... i have made this short because there is no detailed steps on this.

so enjoy some sweet sunnies or frames.
