Very basic method. Anyone can really do it. Just requires cash to start with. Works 100% with Asos.com I have not tried with other companies but you can do so and post Ur luck.

1. Go to Asos.com and pick out the cloths you want. Any amount £600 less I have personally tried and has worked.

2. Wait until you receive the items you brought. Now when the doorman comes to your house, there two possible methods you can do:

2a. Sign the parcel as a different name.
2b. Sign it with Ur normal name.

3. Call them up and if you used: 
2a: Say you have not received nothing and you want a refund. They should gladly just give you the full refund. 
2b: Say you got the items but there were some cloths missing. Now tell them you want a refund on whatever you never got.

4. Thats all there is to it. I have done this many times and its worked every time. I normally used 2b as the method. I buy cheap items and expensive and say the expensive items did not come. Just encase something happens.

This method works 100% in UK. Has not been tested in US or any other country so if it does work for you let me know.

Give me some feedback guys if this method helped. Thanks

For all you fucking mugs who keep making threads. This is for you dickheads.
