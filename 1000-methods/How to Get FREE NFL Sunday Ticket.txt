I have been looking for a method to get free sunday ticket because if your a Directv subscriber you know they have been giving it away to new members and I dont know about you but that was really pissing me off so I made it my goal for the day to get it for free too. I thought it would have taken a while but it only took 20 min!

Step 1: Call Directv. Say what ever you want to the prompt thing
Step 2: When you get a live agent dont say anything except can you transfer me to retentions.
Step 3: When the next agent picks up ask if this is the retentions department. (You can tell because they are retentions depending on what the rep sounds like. If they sound nice and friendly its retentions because they will do ANYTHING to keep you.)
Step 4: Once you know your there ask how much it is to cancel your account right.
Step 5: They sound tell you some number and just say your thinking of canceling because Insert Another Provider name here has better and cheaper service. Say the only thing that is keeping you with Directv is the fact they have the NFL Sunday Ticket. Tell them it is free to new customers and you have been a loyal paying customer and you will switch if you cant get NFL Sunday Ticket for free. 
Step 6: Worst case they will offer you so much of your bill or a reduced price for Sunday Ticket.
Step 7: You can either take that or puss harder.
Step 8: ENJOY!

Note:
You can threaten to cancel all you want the actual retentions rep CANNOT cancel your account.
