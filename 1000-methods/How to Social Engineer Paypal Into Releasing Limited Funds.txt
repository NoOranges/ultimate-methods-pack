Have a paypal account lying around that is limited?
Does it perhaps have some money in it that you wouldn't mind withdrawing?
Skip the 180 days wait by following these steps.

In order to withdraw from your limited account you will need:
- A bank account attached to it
- Have an account that has been limited for at least 21 days


Essentially what you do is wait 21 days after being limited, call in and say "I was told that after 21 days I could withdraw my balance to my bank account."
They may ask you some questions about what the payment was for and such, try to tell as much of the truth as possible but if they were illegitimately obtained leave that part out.
They will say that an account specialist is supposed to review your account, insist that you were called recently and told that you would be able to withdraw, and also stress the fact that when you first got limited you were told the same thing.

Simple as that, they will go ahead and make it so that you can withdraw your locked balance to your bank account.
