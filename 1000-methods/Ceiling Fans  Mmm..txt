Alright, so I was just messing around earlier, and the motor in my ceiling fan is out, so I was like... hmm I'm gonna SE another one!

I did a little bit of research on ceiling fan companies, and the best one to SE seemed to be Craftmade, and I had pretty decent success :)

Basically, go on Amazon and find a model of fan that you like, then e-mail Craftmade support (customerservice@craftmade.com) and give them your excuse. I'm not really sure what all can go wrong with your ceiling fan, but my excuse worked.

It was a legitimate excuse (aside from my fan not being a Craftmade), anyway just tell them the motor burnt out. I suppose you could be extreme and tell them that your fan caught on fire or something, but they'd probably want pictures.

But yeah, getting an entire new ceiling fan in a couple of days. You could probably get a check with this method too, just tell them you got it like a month ago and use the Amazon receipt gen.

Oh, their website is http://www.craftmade.com, but that's relatively useless.

Post results please :)
