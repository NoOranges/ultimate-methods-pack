The company is :belllighting
excuse:  whatever you want, just say product went out fast etc...
bulk: YES :D


email them say your shit went out fast allot this month you believe you may have bought a bad batch. they will ask for the code(s) on the bulbs, provide that.

when you provide that, they will say they couldn't find anything wrong but will ship you a new batch via ups in a MASSIVE AND I MEAN MASSIVE BOX.


please don't rape if you don't need the bulbs.
