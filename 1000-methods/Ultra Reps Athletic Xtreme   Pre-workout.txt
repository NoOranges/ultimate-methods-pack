Fill in the form. 

And say u bought ultra reps and when you opened the box their were little hard parts of powder in it.
And you can't mix it with water.

Normaly they dont ask receipt or batch number.

Few days later you get the ultra reps if you life in the USA

If you life in Europe they refund you.
