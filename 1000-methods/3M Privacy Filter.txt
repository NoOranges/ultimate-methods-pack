1. Select which size of protector you want
2. Go here http://solutions.3m.com/wps/portal/3M/en_US/SDP/Privacy_Filters/Support/Contact_Us/
3. Tell them how you purchased the filter from a retailer (Amazon,newegg or bestbuy)
4. Make it clear that the screen protector was not as advertised and had random blotches where someone could see through the filter
5. They will apologize then ask for shipping info.

It worked for me, you will need to modify the excuse tho because Ive used it and im sure it will be flooded by sikh and others. Im typing with one on my thinkpad right now they are quite nice and fit phones,tablets,laptops and desktop monitors so grab a couple. This could work faster by call but I have not tried it.
