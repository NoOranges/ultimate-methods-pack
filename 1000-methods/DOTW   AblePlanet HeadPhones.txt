Good news , I'll be posting 1 discovery every Monday to get everyone to be active and not regret coming to this forum . And old user for not regretting after purchasing VIP.
This "Event" will be named . DOTW = Discovery of the Week

Contact : info@ableplanet.com

Model : All Headphones

Tell them you have got this Headset which has been lying around for quite sometime , and say it's not working as it doesn't produce any sounds at all when played . And they will ask you to return the headset back , give them the BioHazard reason when you get to the Post-Office and they rejected you . 

This "Event" will end when I've finish posting all my "Discovery" . And I've stop using the term method and replacing with Discovery here because everyone knows the Method behind all this Products , it's just that no one knows which Company are they able to deal with .. 

And stay tune for more "Discovery"
Thank you .

USERS are welcome to pm me with their own discovery and i'll post it up if I've run out of "Discovery" in the near future , Credits of cause will be gaven .

Please do not send my Logitech , Keurig or any other known Company/Brand .
