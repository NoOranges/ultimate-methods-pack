Just go to Activision support: http://support.activision.com/pkb_Home?clickedOn=Elite and live chat (if you're willing to wait, took them almost 3 hours to get to me)

Anyway, just be like (one of the following):

- I used x amount of prestige tokens for double xp and didn't get any on my account
- I was reset and I got my rank back but no double xp
- I had x hours of double xp when i got off and now i don't have any

Enjoy your double xp, not that anyone wants it... MW3 sucks.
