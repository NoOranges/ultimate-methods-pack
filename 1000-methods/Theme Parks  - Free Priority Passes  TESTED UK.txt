This works for all UK theme parks.

1. Email the theme park

2. Tell them you and your group of 8 friends went to the park and queued for 2 hours and then the ride broke, so you waited another hour, and it couldnt be fixed, so you had wasted 3 hours, then you tried another ride and asking a ride operator what to do but they were rude .... you get what im saying

3. Enjoy your priority passes

These passes allow you to walk through the exit of a ride and get on, its like the same as disabled people, you skip the entire queue.
