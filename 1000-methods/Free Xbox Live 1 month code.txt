This is my first method that Im posting so Im sorry for it being a little lame. I just Did this 5 minutes ago so it works.

Step 1
Create a Xbox Live Silver account 

Step 2
Call Up Xbox Live and tell them that you just created your first xbox live account and that it gave you the option to have a free 1 month of gold but you accidentally skipped it.

Step 3
Wait a couple minutes and give him the account info and blah blah blah

Step 4
they should say "I do see this account was just created" and then shortly after they offer to email you a free 1 month

I was on the phone for 10 minutes and it worked no problem
