Ok let me start by saying my first SE was one of these, and i did it about 2 years ago, (maybe there was a guide on it or something? idr) So first you want to go to crest's website, http://www.crest.com/contact-crest.aspx and fill out an email saying that in some way they are faulty (I personally said that the packages seemed to have not been sealed properly and the strips themselves dried up.) Soon they will contact you saying something along these lines:  The King of the Sandbox,  Thanks for contacting us.  We're very concerned about your recent experience and so sorry it happened.  We have many checks in place to ensure the quality of both our products and packaging, and it's important for us to be aware of any potential health or safety issues.  We’d like to evaluate your product and packaging, so I’m sending postage-paid mailing materials you can use to return it to us.  You should know that in some cases it is necessary for us to destroy the product as part of the evaluation.  I’m also sending a replacement kit; look for my mailing to arrive within 2-3 weeks.  Thanks so much for your loyalty, and please don’t hesitate to contact us again if you have other questions or comments.  And thanks again for getting in touch with us.  Beth Crest Team
