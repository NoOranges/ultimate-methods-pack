This method works in the UK. I'm not sure of their policies in other parts of the world so this may be UK only - still worth a try though.

Requirements


An Emporio Armani shop.
Knowledge of the box method.




Go to an Emporio Armani shop and tell them that your watch strap is broken. Ask how you can get it fixed.
They might ask to see the watch, just tell them you haven't brought it with you. They will give you a bag to put your watch in with some forms in to send off.
Fill in the forms with your address etc and put in the model number of the watch you want.
Do a simple box method and send it in. A week or so later, call and ask what is going on with your watch, and they will say that they'll call you back.
They should call you back within a day or two and tell you that the watch has been lost in the post and to pick a watch of the same retail value and they will send you a new one.


Notes: If you don't have an Armani store near you, you can just send an empty bag (make sure it's recorded delivery) to their address (found on the Fossil watches website - Armani watches are made by Fossil) and quote the tracking number when you call up.

Please say thanks, it only takes 2 seconds and keeps the thread alive.
