I've not been super active the past week, so I'm making up by releasing 2 unique VIP methods, this being one.
It's been tested and is working in the UK.

They are £40 bathroom scales, more expensive ones should work, they make up to £80 scales but I didn't want one of those because it "analyses" your body, I just want to know my weight, digitally.

The brand is soehnle, I contacted them via the online form:
(google it, sorry, don't want them to see the referral link of astropid).

They got back to me very quickly, I gave them an amazon receipt (generated with astroproof) and they sent them very quickly too.

There's 3 pictures of proof because I got my grubby prints on the scales, making them look less new, but they were SEd, hence the 3 pics of proof.

Don't saturate it too quickly, I think the team are small.
