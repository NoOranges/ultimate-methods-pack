In the spirit of raping Amazon, let's all jump on this bandwagon and rape Amazon furthermore.
I do this before I SE the kindle.

What you need to SE:
- Kindle Serial. (You can try to work around it.)
- Internet to chat or phone to call.
- New Amazon Account.


Login on the new account and get on chat. Tell the rep that your Powerfast charger ain't working well and they won't see a kindle registered so the rep will register the kindle at that time. Better straight up asking for registration before calling in to say kindle ain't workin'. They will give you $20 promo to use. Then Hop on another chat and say your kindle cover is either broken, caught on fire or come up with an excuse. They will offer you another $20-45 promo credit depending on the excuse. You get total of $60 in promo codes. Order something and once order created, call in or chat and SE the kindle.

The order will be shipped and the kindle will be shipped. Make sure to deregister BOTH kindles before the account closes to insure that the kindles won't get blacklisted!



TLDR;

> Complain about your kindle powerfast charger = $20 promo
> Complain about your kindle cover = $20-45 promo
> Place an Order on Amazon
> SE the kindle since it is already registered.
> Once kindle ships, deregister all the kindles to avoid blacklisting.
> Sit back and wait
> ???
> Profit.

You can place an order and do One day shipping and then ask them to waive the shipping fee if you want.

K. Go and rape Amazon!
