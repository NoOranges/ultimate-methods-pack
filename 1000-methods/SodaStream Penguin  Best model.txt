Call them and say your penguin is not carbonating your water.

You bought the penguin about a month and a half ago and have only used it twice.

They will go through troubleshooting with you continue as usual. They might ask to hear your penguin , start the video at 8 second http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8acyDpOKYIc

They will offer to send you a cabonator, tell them that you have a spare carbonator tank, someone recommend you buy one so you don't have to order another one when it runs out, they will tell you to install it with there instructions, act like you are. Go through the troubleshooting again, they will now offer to send you a replacement. 

This se is not OVER, you still need the glass to use it.

Call them again and say you got your penguin with a broken glass container, they will send you a new one. They won't recognize you are the same person unless you get the same rep so hang up if you get the same rep. I did both parts in one day.
