Most people may know how to SE kitchenaid but my next tip after may be helpful to you all. Checked back 5 pages didnt see any kitchenaid method besides the guy selling one, but thats bullshit. Since when do they allow people to sell easy methods? And im sure the method isn't his anyway cause Ive been doing them since last August.

First off SE Kitchenaid

This Is for the 200$ Stand Mixer, not sure of name but its on their website

1. Find Serial
2. Register Serial
3. Call in and Tell them Your Stand Mixer Will not turn on at all
Alternate Excuses: Suggest using these to avoid saturation
- The Mixer only Goes 1 Speed and the Handle on the side Doesn't Work
- The beaters will not spin but you Hear the motor going inside
- The Mixer runs for about 15 seconds before shutting off
- The Mixers goes extremely slow and you cant control it
- Vice versa Mixer goes too fast and you can't control it
- Mixer Makes Loud POP'ing noises every 3 seconds while running
(Will add more Later)
4. They will issue a replacement

Simple enough eh, now unless you REALLY love to Bake you won't be doing this.
Here is an Idea.

ALL Wal-Marts have something Called a "No Receipt Return Policy" saying that if you have
and item that they sell in their store that is UNOPENED. You can return it for FULL value, but if the
amount exceeds 100$ they can only issue you a Wal-Mart gift Card. So after you get your kitchenaid DO NOT open it.
Just go to walmart and turn it in for a 200$ gift card. I was unlucky cause there was some sale and only got $189.99 but they did give me a refund on the tax as well so it came out to like $198.

Hope you enjoy.
