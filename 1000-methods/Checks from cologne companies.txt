Find your desired cologne/company

Explain how when you sprayed it, it smelled absolutely terrible and nothing like the sample in the store...use your imagination

They should offer you a replacement

if you would rather have a check simply say you drove all the way back to the store to buy another one and want a refund instead

If they don't budge just keep complaining and they will eventually give in and say they'll make an exception for you

I know this isn't very detailed, but....it doesn't really need to be.  Try a bunch of stuff and you will find your own flawless method :D
