Okay, so I have just tried this and it has worked, it does require a serial number and PoP (can be fake)

_____________


Difficulty:
2/10


Requirements:

• Serial number of CoolerMaster Case
• Receipt (I used PayPal Receipt Generator)
• An Email Account


Tutorial:


Step 1:

Go to: http://www.coolermaster.com/tech_support.php?action=Form


Step 2:

Input all your information about your PC


Step 3:

For the 'Comment' part, say something a long the lines of:

"I just bought a Insert Case Name and the fans on the Insert Location of the case don't work, I have tried multiple other fans and they work fine, I really wanted the LED fans as they look really nice. I have bought CoolerMaster products before and have not had a problem like this as the products are usually high quality, Thank you."

*Don't use the exact exuse I did... it will just get obvious, be creative*


Step 4:

You should then receive an email within 24 hours asking for the Serial Number of the case and a Proof of purchase.


Step 5:

Simply use the PayPal receipt generator and get a serial number off Criaglist, eBay etc...


Step 6:

You should then receive another email saying, thank you and that they're sending out your new fans :)


Step 7:

Profit!!
