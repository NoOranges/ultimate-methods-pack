Now for the excuse. I did the scream box set and this is what i said "hi, i recently bought the scream box set and when i went to watch scream  one a few weeks later i noticed the blueray discs were mostly broken.  the store would not take it back because i opened it. could you help me? Sincerly, Ghost"

Now you will get an email by asking for a UPC code. You can find these very easily on ebay by looking up the movie and going into the listing and clicking view more details.

They you will get a email saying "Hi Ghost,

Thanks for providing the information we requested.
  A replacement will be ordered for you (with new packaging) today.
All we need is your full mailing address, and we will ship it out to you as soon as it arrives.
  

Sincerely,
Customer Service 
  Alliance Films Canada"

Enjoy your free movie!
