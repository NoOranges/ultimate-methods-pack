They are pretty much a tech-deck with storage capabilities.

I got 4 of them one for me and a couple more for some friend.

They come in different sizes, 4gb, 8gb, 16gb.

1. Email them here- info@actionsportdrives.com

2. Make up a story include your USB type (Snowboard/Skate/Etc..)

3. They will troubleshoot.

4. You get your replacement or you have to show proof of purchase then you get replacement.

5. Enjoy your sweet new USB

(Did not make PM-only like normal because many members have been contributing and it is nice to see a semi-active community once again)

Testing is complete,congrats Astro you failed with flying colors.
