I just bought off ebay with paypal a sidewinder x6 keyboard. Once I receive it, I plan to wait a few extra days, and then claim I did not receive the product, and eventually hopefully get my money back(if not oh well only paid $40 for it). Once i get it though, is it possible to do any, if not multiple SE's with it?
