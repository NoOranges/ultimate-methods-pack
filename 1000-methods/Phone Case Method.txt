Introduction
In the past, we have seen many methods for phone cases, predominately the Otterbox method. Today, I am providing the VIPs here with a new case/screen protector company: Amzer.

Company Information
Website: http://amzer.com/
Contact: http://www.amzer.com/contact/

Requirements


Any receipt generator.


Method


Contact Amzer regarding a fault with their product(s). 
Pro-tip: They have crappy silicone.
They will ask for picture proof. Obtain it and complete the SE, or avoid it and ask if you can provide a receipt instead.
Pro-tip: By the way, if you're going to say your camera is broken so you can give them a generated receipt, and taking a picture of the generated receipt using a camera, I will personally send Sikh Militants to your house.
They will send the case to the address on the receipt.
