I have a sodastream and I know that its extremely expensive to keep replacing the co2 so here's how you get it for free.



1. Go to a refill place

2. Tell them that you spoke with soda stream and they said that your item was empty when you got it and that you are entitled to a free replacement from any refill place and to label your bottle defective when they send it back.

3. Profit.
