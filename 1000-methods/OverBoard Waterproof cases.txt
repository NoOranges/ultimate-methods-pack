Recently I started checking new companies to SE and I came across OverBoard and this is written on their website:

OverBoard waterproof bags – keeping your gear dry!For beach, boat, board and life; our super-sturdy waterproof bags and cases come in all different shapes and sizes and are designed to keep your gear dry and protected from sand, dirt and dust.
Whether you’re taking a trip to the beach with your latest gadget, embarking on a week-long boat trip, or taking gear on a kitesurfing downwinder; there’s an OverBoard waterproof case, bag or dry bag to suit every need. So browse away and …keep it dry! 

Pretty nice and handy thing when you going to the beach, river etc. so I tried them, succeeded and I decide to share a method.

1. go to this link: http://www.over-board.co.uk/

2. in top right corner choose you country

3. choose what you want to SE

4. check some reviews about that product if they ask you something

5. send them a mail with some excuse (leaked when you put it in the water, can't be sealed properly etc.)

6. they will say that they are sorry and may or may not ask for a pictures of a product, but it's not a problem you can SE your way from there (you know how, I don't need to spoonfeed)

7. after you answer them, they will say that they are sending a replacement


Proof:

I had to hide first sentence, don't want someone to use my excuse.
