I know this method is in Dopeland Care, but I knew this method well before Dopeland Care existed, so I believe I have rights to publish it.

Beware: Iomega ALWAYS wants you to return the hard drive. It might be possible to get around it, but I would suggest to use a drop.

I will just post a pic of the conversation log, you will get the idea of it. You need to obtain a serial and make a fake receipt (they won't confirm it) and then you're good to go.

Go to Iomega's site (Choose your own region!), make a support account and open a live chat.

SERIALS: PM me if you think you deserve 256gb SSD serial!
