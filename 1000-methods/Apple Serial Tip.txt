Okay so this is a pretty simple and most likely well known way of getting unregistered apple serials.

First thing your gonna wanna get is a serial from the WebGen.

For this instance I will use a Macbook Pro Serial: C02DCXXXDC79

For most serials you can simple change the X to any number or letter.

Once you get an unregistered serial you will get this message:

After that your set. Call apple or do whatever.

This might already be posted but I dont think so.
