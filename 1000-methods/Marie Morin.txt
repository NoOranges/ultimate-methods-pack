Hello

Here is a method I discovered by myself.

Some weeks ago Marie Morin take all their Marie Morin chocolat mousse 100gr back because their were parts of glass in some of the Chocolat mousses.

- First go to the site of marie morin ( http://www.marie-morin.fr/ ) Go to the contact page on the right upper corner off the site.

Explain the story if they ask exp date etc give this ONLY THIS INFO WORKS 

Marie Morin chocolat mousse 100gr - EXP DATE : 19/08/2013 - EAN : 3372900017899

they will send you a mail and refund you :)

You can do this in bulk.

If questions send me a pm.
