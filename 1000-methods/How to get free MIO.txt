2)Explain to them that the MIO tasted watery and had no impact what so ever. Make sure to include that you bought this before and know how it tastes.
3)They should email you back stating that it must have been a "The problem you described sounds like the product was not properly stored during distribution"
4)They will ask you for: "your complete name & mailing address  along with the UPC, best when used by dates & production run  information located on the bottom of the bottles before I can do so."
